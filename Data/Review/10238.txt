Review of literature

The literature on UGC regulations concerning the
appointment of teaching positions in state universities
highlights a significant debate regarding their mandatory
versus directory nature, informed by recent Supreme Court
judgments. The review of literature indicates a consensus on
the importance of UGC regulations in ensuring quality in
higher education. The Supreme Court’s recent judgments
have reinforced the interpretation that these regulations are
mandatory for state universities. However, ongoing debates
regarding their directory aspects suggest a need for further
exploration. Future research should aim to fill gaps in
understanding the practical implications of these regulations
and their impact on the educational landscape in India.

Significance of the study

Understanding whether UGC regulations are mandatory or
directory is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it impacts the
legal framework governing academic appointments,
influencing how universities recruit faculty members.
Secondly, it has broader implications for the quality of
higher education in India, as adherence to established
standards is vital for ensuring that educators possess the
requisite qualifications and expertise. Lastly, this analysis
can inform future legal interpretations and educational
policies, contributing to the ongoing discourse on academic
governance in Indian higher education.

In conclusion, this paper will provide a comprehensive
analysis of the legal and educational implications of UGC
regulations for teaching appointments in state universities,
framed within the context of recent Supreme Court
judgments. By doing so, it aims to contribute to the broader
understanding of regulatory frameworks in higher education
and their significance for maintaining academic excellence.

Legal framework

The UGC Act, 1956 empowers the Commission to establish
norms for the selection and appointment of teaching staff.
The guidelines laid out by the UGC are intended to ensure a
standardized approach to faculty recruitment across
universities State Universities and autonomy. State
universities operate under their respective state laws and
often enjoy a degree of autonomy in administrative matters.
This autonomy raises questions about the applicability of
UGC regulations, particularly when state laws and UGC
guidelines diverge. University Grant Commission (UGC)
regulations are typically obligatory for statutory universities
in India. Statutory universities are established by an act of
parliament or state legislature, and they operate under the
purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC). The
UGC Act of 1956 empowers the UGC to coordinate,
determine, and maintain standards of higher education. The
term “University” has a wider connotation under Section
2(f) of the Act. It reads as "University means a University
established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a
Provincial Act or a State Act, and includes any such

98

institution as may, in consultation with the University
concerned, be recognised by the Commission in accordance
with the regulations made in this behalf under this Act." The
UGC issues regulations from time to time to ensure quality
and uniformity in the education provided by these
universities. These regulations cover various aspects,
including curriculum design, faculty qualifications,
infrastructure, and other parameters deemed essential for
maintaining academic standards. The UGC Act provides a
legal framework for the establishment and functioning of
universities, and it confers the UGC with the authority to
make regulations regarding various aspects of higher
education. Section 22 of the UGC Act for instance, specifies
that only universities established by a Central, State, or
Provincial Act or an institution deemed to be a university
under Section 3 of the Act have the right to confer degrees.
This provision highlights the regulatory control that the
UGC exercises over universities. In addition to statutory
provisions, the UGC Act empowers the UGC to take
necessary steps for promoting and coordinating university
education and determining and maintaining standards. This
broad authority includes the formulation of regulations to be
followed by universities.

The UGC, through its regulations, aims to ensure that
universities adhere to certain minimum standards and
benchmarks, thereby safeguarding the quality of higher
education in the country. Statutory universities derive their
authority from specific legislation enacted by the
government, conferring legal status and autonomy. The
UGC, established in 1956, was created to regulate and
maintain the standards of higher education in the country. It

formulates guidelines and regulations that statutory
universities are expected to adhere to. The question of
whether these regulations are mandatory or

recommendatory has been a matter of judicial consideration.

Judgment relied

T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) 8 SCC
481, The Supreme Court in this case emphasized the
autonomy of educational institutions while recognizing the
regulatory role of bodies like the UGC. The court held that
UGC regulations are binding and must be followed by
universities to ensure quality and standards in education.
This decision reinforced the mandatory nature of UGC
regulations on statutory universities.

Moreover, in the case of University Grants Commission v.
P.K. Mukherjee (2002) 4 SCC 211, The court reiterated the
mandatory nature of UGC regulations on universities. The
judgment emphasized that universities established under a
statute are subject to UGC regulations, and any deviation
would be against the principles of maintaining uniformity
and excellence in education.

Further judicial pronouncements, such as the Islamic
Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka, (2003) 6 SCC
697 & Bhupendra Nath Hazarika v. State of Assam, (2013)
11 SCC 706 reiterated the significance of adhering to UGC
regulations. The court emphasized that the autonomy of
educational institutions does not grant them absolute
freedom from regulatory mechanisms, especially those
aimed at maintaining academic excellence and integrity.
These decisions collectively reinforce the mandatory nature
of UGC regulations.

On 21st October 2022, in the case of Professor (Dr.) Sreejith
P.S. v. Dr. Rajasree M.S. & Ors. 2022 Live Law (SC) 871
--- Page 3 ---
International Journal of Law

the Apex Court in a Division Bench comprising of Justice
M.R. Shah and Justice C.T. Ravikumar opined that solely
because the subsequent amendment has not been
specifically adopted by the State cannot be a ground by the
State to contend that the amendment to the Regulations shall
not be binding on the State's Universities.

Most recently SC in Mehar Fatima Husain v. Jamia Millia
Islamia & ors (2020) 3 SCC 373, Made it more clear that the
University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations are
binding on the Universities, and the Supreme Court directed
the reinstatement of the teachers at Jamia Millia Islamia
(“University”) on a permanent basis who were denied
regularization by the University even after UGC's letter to
University directing regularization of the teachers who were
selected through a regular selection process and possessed
required qualifications.

Justice Abhay S. Oka emphasized on the binding nature of
UGC regulations while citing the case of Kalyani
Mathivanan v. K.V. Jeyaraj j& ors (2021) 2 SCC 160,
where in para 27 the court observed as follows: “we hold
that the UGC Regulations though a subordinate legislation
has binding effect on the universities to which it applies;
and consequence of failure of the university to comply with
the recommendations of the Commission, UGC may
withhold the grants to the university made out of the fund of
the Commission".

Relaying on the ratio of Kalyani Mathivanan, the Hon'ble
court in the present case quoted that "It is true that the letter
dated 25th June 2019 addressed by the UGC has used the
word 'may'. However, considering the statutory position of
the UGC, there was no reason for the University not to
follow what the UGC stated."

University of Kerala v. Council of Principals of Colleges,
(2010) 10 SCC 209, The Apex court has held that
emphasized the importance of adhering to UGC norms,
indicating that while state universities have autonomy, they
must also comply with the standards set by the UGC to
ensure quality.

The State of Maharashtra v. D. B. S. Jain College, (2018) 4
SCC 96, The Supreme Court reinforced the idea that UGC
regulations are binding on state universities, highlighting
that the overarching goal of maintaining educational
standards must prevail over local administrative autonomy.
Rajendra Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2021) 9 SCC 541,
The Court provided further clarity by asserting that non-
compliance with UGC regulations could lead to legal
consequences, emphasizing their mandatory nature.

In the case of Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi v. The State of
Gujarat (2022) 3 SCC 143, The Supreme Court addressed
the interpretation of UGC regulations, specifically whether
they are mandatory or directory. The court concluded that
UGC regulations are indeed mandatory, meaning that
educational institutions must comply with them strictly.

Analysis of the Judgments

The cumulative effect of these judgments suggests a trend
towards recognizing UGC regulations as mandatory. The
Supreme Court has consistently held that while state
universities retain a degree of autonomy, compliance with
UGC standards is essential to uphold the integrity of higher
education.

Mandatory v. Directory

Mandatory Nature: The judicial interpretations point
towards a mandatory understanding of UGC regulations.
Non-compliance could undermine educational standards and
lead to adverse legal implications for state universities.

Directory Nature: Some argue that since state universities
are governed by their own statutes, UGC regulations may be
seen as directory, allowing for flexibility. However, this
perspective appears to be diminishing in light of judicial
trends.

State autonomy v. Uge regulations: State universities
possess the authority to manage their academic affairs,
including the appointment of faculty. However, this
autonomy is not absolute and must be exercised within the
framework set by the UGC. The court has clarified that
autonomy does not equate to a free pass from compliance
with regulatory standards. The Supreme Court has sought a
balance between the autonomy of state universities and the
necessity of adhering to UGC regulations. This balance is
critical for maintaining educational standards and ensuring
that institutions do not deviate from established norms,
which could compromise the quality of education.

Implications on higher education

= Quality Assurance: Mandatory compliance with UGC
regulations ensures a consistent quality of education
across state universities, which is vital for maintaining
academic standards.

= Legal Certainty: Clarity in the mandatory nature of
UGC regulations reduces ambiguity for universities
regarding faculty recruitment and qualifications,
leading to a more streamlined process.

= Uniformity in Standards: Adherence to UGC
guidelines helps maintain uniformity in educational
standards across different states, benefiting students and
the overall education system.

= Accountability: Institutions are held accountable for
their hiring practices, ensuring that qualified individuals
are appointed to teaching positions, which ultimately
enhances the learning experience for students.

= Impact on Autonomy: While state universities have
the freedom to govern themselves, this freedom is now
balanced with the need for compliance with national
standards, ensuring that autonomy does not lead to a
decline in educational quality.

Suggestions and recommendations
1. Policy Clarification: Recommend that the UGC
provide clear, detailed guidelines on which
regulations are mandatory and which may have
flexibility, reducing ambiguity for _ state
universities.

2. Training and Capacity Building: Suggest the
establishment of training programs for university
administrators and faculty on UGC regulations,
ensuring all stakeholders understand _ their
responsibilities and the importance of compliance.
--- Page 4 ---
International Journal of Law

3. Enhanced Compliance Mechanisms: Advocate
for the development of robust compliance
monitoring systems that can periodically review
and evaluate adherence to UGC regulations in state
universities.

4. Legal Support Framework: Propose the creation
of a legal support framework to assist universities
in navigating compliance with UGC regulations,
potentially involving legal clinics or advisory
boards.

5. Stakeholder Engagement: Encourage regular
consultations between the UGC, state universities,
and other stakeholders to foster dialogue on
regulatory practices and address _ challenges
collaboratively.

6. Increased Funding for Compliance: Recommend
that the government allocate specific funding to
state universities to support the implementation of
UGC regulations, particularly in areas such as
faculty recruitment and training.

7. Future Research Directions: Identify key areas
for future research, such as the long-term effects of
compliance with UGC regulations on educational!
outcomes or institutional reputation.

8. Public Awareness Campaigns: Suggest initiatives
to raise public awareness about the importance of
UGC regulations in ensuring quality education,
which could include workshops, seminars, and
online resources.

Conclusion

These judicial pronouncements underscore the legal
obligation of statutory universities to adhere to UGC
regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations can
lead to legal consequences, including the withdrawal of
grants and recognition by the UGC. It is crucial to note that
the UGC's regulations are not mere guidelines but have
legal backing. The UGC Act and relevant judicial
pronouncements affirm the mandatory nature of these
regulations for statutory universities. By complying with
these regulations, universities contribute to the overall
enhancement of the quality and credibility of higher
education in India. In conclusion, UGC regulations are
mandatory for statutory universities, as established by the
UGC Act and supported by a plethora of judicial
pronouncements. These regulations play a vital role in
maintaining standards, ensuring uniformity, and upholding
the quality of higher education. Compliance with UGC
regulations is not only a legal obligation but also a crucial
aspect of fostering excellence in the academic arena. In
conclusion, the analysis indicates that UGC regulations
regarding the appointment of teaching positions in state
universities are indeed mandatory. Recent, Supreme Court
judgments affirm this position, emphasizing the importance
of adherence to these regulations in promoting quality
education. As the higher education landscape continues to
evolve, the need for standardized regulatory frameworks
remains paramount, ensuring that state universities
contribute effectively to the nation’s educational goals.
