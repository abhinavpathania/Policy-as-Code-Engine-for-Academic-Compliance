Guidelines on Public Self-Disclosure by Higher Education Institutions
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes transparent self-
disclosure by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Public self-disclosure by HEIs,
in fact, is one of the fundamental principles of the policy. NEP contemplates that
HEIs shall be responsible and accountable to the stakeholders through transparent

self-disclosure of all relevant records.

2. The availability of information in the public domain is an important source

of accountability.

3. Stakeholders in the higher education system such as students, parents,
research scholars, prospective students, regulatory bodies, accreditation
agencies, alumni, and the public desire to seek information from the websites of
HEIs.

4. Every Higher Education Institution shall maintain a functional website for
making relevant self-disclosure to the stakeholders. The disclosure made on the
website shall have unrestricted access without any requirement of log-

in/registration and shall have a ‘Search’ facility for easy access.
