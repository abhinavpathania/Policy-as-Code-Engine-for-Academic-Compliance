UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
NOTIFICATION
New Delhi, the 4th April, 2025

University Grants Commission (Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications Obtained From
Foreign Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2025

F. No. 1-9/2023(Equivalence).—Whereas, the role of the University Grants Commission in the
internationalisation of the Indian education system has increased manifold in the wake of India’s renewed thrust on
academic collaboration with foreign countries and in the context of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, and
as a background, University Grants Commission issued the Guidelines for Internationalisation of Education in July,
2021 which enumerate a wide array of activities such as internationally relevant curricula, the brand building of Indian
Educational Institutions abroad, academic and research collaboration with foreign universities, credit recognition
under twinning arrangements, a global citizenship approach, and engaging with foreign alumni;

And whereas, the University Grants Commission has notified regulations on Academic Collaboration between
Indian and Foreign Higher Educational Institutions to offer Twinning, Joint Degree, and Dual Degree Programmes,
2022 and it has also evolved the National Higher Education Qualifications Framework which is an instrument for the
classification and recognition of qualifications according to a set of criteria for specified levels of learning achieved
and it is expected that the mobility of students will be greatly enhanced as a result of these reforms;

And whereas, there is a need for a more comprehensive and effective education system incorporating general
(academic), vocational, and experiential learning and this integration will encompass relevant experiences and
proficiency levels, with vertical and horizontal mobility for students at all levels, including School and Higher
Education;

And whereas, to facilitate this vision, the National Credit Framework has also been devised as an inclusive
meta-framework, seamlessly unifying the credits acquired through school education, higher education, vocational, and
skill education; which serves as an instrumental tool for classifying and recognising qualifications based on specific
criteria for the achieved level of learning;

And whereas, in furtherance of the above, and to enable the smooth mobility of students, a robust and
transparent mechanism for recognising foreign qualifications and granting equivalence to such qualifications at both
school and higher education levels is deemed necessary, which will be overseen by the University Grants
Commission.

Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by clauses (f) and (g) of sub-section (1) of section 26 read
with clause (j) of section 12 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956, the University Grants Commission
hereby makes the following regulations, namely:

1. Short title, application, and commencement. — (1) These regulations may be called the University Grants
Commission (Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications obtained from Foreign Educational Institutions)

(c) “Equivalence Certificate” means a document certifying the parity of a qualification in terms of level

Universities;

(d) “Fee” means the application processing fee payable by the students while applying for an Equivalence

(d)

(e)

where the same is a component of that programme of study;

the requirement of a thesis, project, internship, other hands-on or experiential learning under the
programme of study, if the corresponding programme of study offered in India mandates such a

accreditation in the country where such Off-Shore Campus is located, as well as any such requirements in

educational institution in India, subject to the following, namely:-

(a)

(b)

(6)

the system of school education prevailing in the foreign country is being considered at present for
