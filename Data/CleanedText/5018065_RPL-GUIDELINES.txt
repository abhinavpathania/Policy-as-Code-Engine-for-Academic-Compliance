FOREWORD
Improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and fostering prospects for lifelong learning are
key recommendations outlined in the National Education Policy 2020. Formal education is not
the only way to acquire knowledge, skills, and competencies; they can also be gained through
jobs, family, traditional inheritance, etc. Yet there is no way to certify these experiences/skills
in higher education. Consequently, they face poorer career prospects. Bridging the gap between
such learning and formal education, therefore, is essential for lifelong learning and improving
employment opportunities.
The National Credit Framework (NCrF) enables one to make use of all forms of learning
irrespective of how the learning occurred. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is practised
globally to creditize experience, skills and competencies leading to formal qualifications. RPL
is an assessment process to evaluate existing skills and knowledge against learning outcomes
defined for formal qualifications.
The advantages of RPL are many. It contributes to economic growth and a more skilled
workforce. It promotes social inclusion and equity for disadvantaged groups by recognizing
experiential learning and providing opportunities to obtain qualifications.
IT am happy to present the Guidelines for Implementation of Recognition of Prior Learning
(RPL) in Higher Education. The guidelines explain the applicability of RPL in formal learning,
informal learning and non-formal learning, methods of assessment, creditization, and
assessment bodies. It also provides a digital framework for RPL.
I congratulate the Expert Committee under the chairmanship of Prof. Rajesh Hegde, IIT
Kanpur, for developing these guidelines. I am sure these guidelines will help learners use the
RPL pathway to obtain qualifications and improve their socio-economic status.

UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION
Guidelines for Implementation of Recognition
for Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education
1. Introduction
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a formal mechanism used to evaluate a person's existing
knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.
Formal learning occurs in educational institutions, while non-formal learning takes place outside
formal settings and may lack certain structured elements. Informal learning is self-directed and
unplanned, often occurring through everyday activities and experiences. The competencies
(knowledge, skills, and abilities) gained informally or non-formally are often not formally
recognized or certified.
RPL plays a crucial role in integrating informal and non-formal learning into the formal
education system through the elaborate process of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) subject
to assessment. It offers individuals the opportunity to formalize their competencies (knowledge,
skills, and abilities) and earn credits through a well-defined framework.
Globally, hiring trends have shifted towards prioritizing skills over formal degrees. This change
reflects the growing recognition of practical abilities and competencies. The abundance of digital
content available online supports this trend by encouraging self-directed and continuous
learning. Many of these resources are accessible in various languages or can be easily translated,
making them more inclusive and adaptable to individual learning preferences.
The entry requirement for enrolment in higher education is typically a "certificate obtained after
successful completion of Grade 12 or equivalent." Similarly, every formal education or skilling
qualification has a prescribed entry requirement. RPL opens doors for individuals who may not
have such formal entry qualifications but possess valuable experience and expertise, making
them eligible to enter higher education. For instance, an artist with years of independent practice
and experience may face challenges in gaining entry to prestigious art institutions for formal
qualifications. Through RPL, such candidates can receive credits for their prior learning,
potentially gaining entry into higher education degrees and even completing their programs more
quickly.
RPL recognizes that learning happens in many forms, not just formally. It assesses and evaluates
an individual's existing competencies and work experiences, regardless of how they were
acquired. This can include formal education, on-the-job training, volunteer work, personal
projects, and life experiences. By recognizing informally acquired skills, RPL helps bridge the
gap between traditional education and real-world experience. This approach is especially
beneficial for individuals who lack formal qualifications but possess valuable knowledge and
abilities, allowing their skills to be acknowledged and validated in the professional realm.
--- Page 7 ---
The RPL process can help individuals acquire a formal qualification that matches their
competencies (knowledge, skills, and abilities), thereby improving their employability, mobility,
lifelong learning, and self-esteem. For India, RPL represents a disruptive innovation that could
significantly contribute to improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.
1.1 Background to Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in the Context of the National
Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Credit Framework (NCrF)
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the creation of a knowledge society in
India to empower citizens in all spheres of life. Consequently, the need for Recognition of Prior
Learning (RPL) in India stems from the national objective of fostering a lifelong learning society,
providing opportunities for citizens to acquire knowledge and skills continuously.
According to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, more than 90% of India’s workforce is
employed in the informal sector, contributing to about half of the country’s Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). This unorganized sector, characterized by enterprises with fewer than 10
workers, employs 83% of the workforce. Additionally, 92.4% of workers are classified as
informal, lacking written contracts, paid leave, and other benefits. The informal sector generally
has lower productivity compared to the formal sector. Workers often face challenges such as the
absence of career pathways and the inability to obtain experience certificates or formal
recognition for the skills and knowledge acquired on the job. Many also cannot pursue higher
education, even if they desire to do so.
Therefore, it is essential to establish a system that acknowledges the skills individuals acquire
outside the formal education system and provides opportunities for upward mobility. To support
these learners, NEP 2020 includes provisions for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), a process
designed to acknowledge non-formal, informal, and experiential learning. RPL utilizes various
assessment methods to evaluate and assign credits for the skills and knowledge individuals have
gained outside traditional education systems.
The National Credit Framework (NCrF), formulated in alignment with NEP 2020, facilitates the
creditization of all forms of learning, including academic, vocational, and experiential. The NCrF
also allows for the recognition and creditization of the existing knowledge and skills of the
workforce acquired through various means. This framework enables workers to access further
education and enhance their employability, thereby improving their career prospects and
contributing to a more skilled and productive workforce in India.
1.2 Recognition of Prior Learning in Higher Education: Perspectives
To fully understand and grasp the need, benefits, and processes of RPL, it is essential to consider
it from various perspectives. This comprehensive view ensures that society as a whole can benefit
from this framework. This section deals with the National, International, and Industry
perspectives on RPL.
1.2.1 Indian Perspectives
The National Credit Framework (NCrF) promotes broad-based, multidisciplinary, and holistic
education by assigning credits to all types of learning. This includes integrating credits from
academic domains and experiential learning, such as internships, apprenticeships, on-the-job
training, and work experience. With the introduction of the NCrF and the Academic Bank of
Credits (ABC) as recommended in NEP 2020, RPL has become a transformative tool for higher
education. RPL has the potential to unlock the abilities of individuals who have gained
--- Page 8 ---
knowledge and skills through diverse avenues beyond traditional classrooms, paving the way for
educational advancement and personal growth.
The RPL process, integrated into the NCrF, provides individuals with formal qualifications
aligned with their competencies, thereby enhancing their employability, mobility, and lifelong
learning prospects. For higher education, embracing RPL within the NCrF framework presents
both opportunities and challenges. Transitioning from a traditional, one-size-fits-all approach to
a more dynamic and learner-centric model demands a revaluation of assessment methods,
curriculum structures, and industry collaborations.
In July 2022, the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) issued
guidelines for blended learning in Vocational Education, Training, and Skilling. Blended
learning is a learner-centric approach that integrates face-to-face (synchronous) and online
(asynchronous) experiences, including simulations, to meet intended learning objectives.
These Guidelines may be accessed at: https://ncvet.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/
Guidelines-for-Blended-Learning-for-Vocational-Education-Training-Skilling.pdf
In December 2022, the University Grants Commission (UGC) released the Curriculum and
Credit Framework for Undergraduate Programs. Additionally, in August 2023, NCVET
published guidelines on Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Vocational Education, Training,
and Skilling. These guidelines can be accessed https://www.uge.gov.in/ pdfnews/_7193743
FYUGP.pdf. and https://ncvet.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Final-RPL-guidelines.pdf.
The FICCI-EY Parthenon Report 2023, titled “Transformation of Indian Higher Education:
Strategies to Leapfrog,” underscores the urgent need to establish robust Recognition of Prior
Learning (RPL) systems in India. It identifies RPL as a critical element to achieve the
government’s target of attaining a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 50% in higher education by
2035. The report can be accessed at EY-Parthenon FICCI report : Transformation of Indian higher
education Strategies to leapfrog (EY-Parthenon FICCI report : Transformation of Indian higher
education Strategies to leapfrog).
[1.2.2 Global Perspectives
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is known by various terms around the world, depending on
the country or region. In Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, it is commonly referred to
as RPL. In the United States, it is known as 'Prior Learning Assessment! (PLA), while in Canada,
it is called 'Prior Learning Assessment Recognition’ (PLAR). Additionally, terms like
‘Accreditation of Prior Learning' (APL) and 'Validation of Prior Learning' (VPL) are used
internationally to denote similar processes. These terms reflect different approaches to formally
recognizing and validating the skills and knowledge individuals have acquired through non-
traditional means.
Australia
In Australia, the Higher Education Standards Framework mandates the assessment of RPL. The
Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) recognizes RPL as a pathway for admission and/or
credit, accessible to all applicants for any qualification at all levels. Higher education institutions
are encouraged to provide diverse pathways into their undergraduate and postgraduate programs,
including enabling admission and granting credits to learners from diverse backgrounds based
on their prior learning experiences.
--- Page 9 ---
Malaysia
In Malaysia, the RPL program allows prospective students without prior qualifications to apply
for certificates, diplomas, undergraduate, and master’s degrees through the Accreditation of Prior
Experiential Learning (APEL) process, which includes aptitude tests, assessments, evaluations,
and portfolio submissions.
South Africa
In South Africa, RPL is integrated with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) to address
past educational, training, and employment disparities. This framework aims to accelerate the
redressal of past unfair discrimination.
New Zealand
The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) recognizes the need for lifelong learning to
maintain an updated workforce through RPL. This allows individuals to have their prior learning,
whether acquired through work experience, formal education, or informal settings, formally
recognized and credited towards achieving qualifications within the New Zealand Qualifications
Framework (NZQF).
Ireland
In Ireland, RPL is an integral component of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030,
which emphasizes the need for policies on credit accumulation, credit transfer, and the formal
assessment of knowledge previously acquired by learners.
Other Countries
Countries such as Sweden, Finland, Canada, and the USA have developed RPL approaches
tailored to specific circumstances, catering to the needs of various social groups, including
immigrants and defense personnel. This helps immigrants gain quicker access to employment
opportunities that match their qualifications and experience. Military personnel and veterans can
translate their training and experience into academic credentials, facilitating their transition to
civilian careers or further education.
International Organizations
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and International Labour Conferences (ILC) have
emphasized the importance of RPL and recommended establishing RPL systems. The ILO's
Recommendation on Human Resources Development: Education, Training, and Lifelong
Learning (No. 195) urges member states to establish frameworks for recognizing and certifying
skills gained through prior learning and experience. It emphasizes that these skills should be
recognized irrespective of where they were acquired (locally or internationally) and whether they
were acquired formally or informally. The ILC's 2014 report on “Transitioning from the Informal
to the Formal Economy” highlights the necessity of developing institutions and mechanisms to
assess, validate, and certify skills and competencies acquired through prior learning.
European Commission
A 2013 report by the European Commission highlighted the importance of RPL. Out of 47 higher
education systems for which data was available, RPL could be used for facilitating access,
--- Page 10 ---
seeking admission to higher education, or progressing within higher education (European
Commission, 2013).
1.2.3 Industry Perspectives
Industry bodies have emphasized the significance of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and
advocate for a flexible and innovative approach within the framework of the National Credit
Framework (NCrF). Continuous engagement with industry stakeholders is crucial to aligning
higher education with the evolving needs of the workforce, identifying RPL opportunities that
cater to industry-specific skills and competencies.
To ensure effectiveness, industries suggest implementing a dynamic RPL process that adapts to
current trends and technologies. Industry experts should play a pivotal role in shaping and
reviewing RPL criteria to maintain relevance and practical application. Moreover, RPL can
facilitate career transitions, allowing individuals with degrees in one field to obtain recognition
and certification for skills acquired in adjacent domains through work experience.
Industries also propose innovative pathways such as offering master’s degrees after a certain
threshold of experience, supported by continuous professional development (CPD) and bridging
programs. These measures aim to enhance educational and professional development
opportunities throughout an individual's career, reflecting the dynamic nature of modern
industries.
An essential aspect of RPL in higher education is integrating industry learning into the NCrF.
This integration can be based on on-the-job experience, self-study, blended learning, and
participation in training programs, seminars, workshops, and conferences conducted by industry
associations and other bodies. These programs impart specific knowledge and skills and can be
internal or external, online or offline.
Individuals working in industry could greatly benefit from earning credits for similar activities.
These credits could then be used to pursue higher education programs (Bachelor's, Master's,
Doctoral, Post-Doctoral, etc.) or to enter a program at an advanced level, such as starting in the
second or third year.
This approach would recognize the professional development and skills acquired through
industry experience, enabling individuals to leverage their practical knowledge and contributions
within educational frameworks. It aligns with the NCrF philosophy that all learning can be
credited, facilitating smoother transitions and enhancing educational opportunities for
professionals across different sectors of the economy.

Objectives, Purpose, and Benefits of RPL in Higher Education
2.1
Objectives of the Guidelines
The objectives of RPL guidelines in higher education are as follows:
1.
Provide Access to Higher Education: Enable individuals who have acquired
competencies through non-formal and informal learning methods to access higher
education programs.
Offer Flexible Pathways: Create diverse and flexible pathways for individuals with
various educational backgrounds and learning experiences to access higher education based
on their demonstrated competencies.
Foster Continuous Learning: Promote a culture of continuous learning to equip
individuals with the updated skills and knowledge necessary to meet evolving career
demands.
Encourage Lifelong Learning: Support lifelong learning to develop a competent and
adaptable workforce capable of meeting the challenges of a rapidly changing labor market.
Promote Equity: Acknowledge and value experiential learning to offer marginalized
groups the opportunity to obtain recognized qualifications and improve their socio-
economic status.
Facilitate Workforce Transition: Assist in transitioning the workforce from informal
work settings to the formal sector by recognizing and validating their skills and knowledge.
Enhance Social Inclusion: Promote social inclusion and equity for disadvantaged groups
by recognizing experiential learning and providing opportunities to obtain qualifications.
Meet Regulatory Requirements: Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in
certain sectors by employing qualified individuals.
Address Industry Needs: Meet specific industry or sectoral requirements by recognizing
prior learning, thereby enhancing employability and ensuring that individuals can
effectively contribute and meet regulatory standards.
Improve Job Prospects: Validate and certify skills acquired through practical experience,
thereby improving job prospects and career advancement opportunities, and making
individuals more attractive to employers.
In this context the guidelines provide broad guidelines and a structured framework that will
govern the design and implementation of RPL processes in the Indian context. These guidelines
serve several key purposes, which include the following:
a) Standardization: Establish consistent procedures for assessing and recognizing prior
learning across different institutions and programs. This ensures equitable
recognition of RPL and guarantees that assessments are conducted impartially,
transparently, and consistently, regardless of an individual's background or situation.
b) Quality Assurance: Implement governance mechanisms and standards to maintain
the credibility and reliability of RPL assessments. These mechanisms ensure that
assessors are qualified and competent, that assessment methods are valid and reliable,
and that outcomes are trustworthy and dependable.
c) Clarity and Transparency: Provide explicit guidance on preparing and submitting
RPL applications, specify the types of evidence needed, and outline assessment
procedures. This clarity ensures that all stakeholders understand their roles and
--- Page 12 ---
expectations throughout the RPL process, promoting fairness and consistency in
assessment outcomes.
d) Integration and Inclusion: Recognize that learning can occur through formal
education, informal experiences, work-based learning, or other means. RPL
integrates these diverse learning outcomes into the assessment process, ensuring they
are appropriately recognized and credited. This requires engaging with a wide range
of stakeholders such as employers, professional bodies, community organizations,
and vocational education and training providers to contribute to the assessment and
validation of prior learning, enhancing pathways for learners to enter and progress
within the higher education system.
e) Support and Guidance: Provide comprehensive information on preparing for
assessments, accessing assistance or advice, and utilizing available resources to
support learning and development. This may include online tools, workshops,
tutorials, or recommended readings to enhance understanding of the RPL process and
improve preparation for assessments.
f) Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess the performance and outcomes of RPL
processes to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This involves
tracking completion rates, satisfaction levels among candidates and assessors, and the
consistency of learning outcomes. Higher education institutions and stakeholders
should continuously review and refine RPL processes based on feedback, evolving
needs, and emerging best practices to maintain and enhance the effectiveness and
responsiveness of RPL in meeting learners' needs and expectations.
g) Accessibility and Equity: Promote access to education, training, and employment
opportunities by providing pathways for individuals to have their prior learning
recognized and validated. These guidelines help remove barriers to participation and
ensure that RPL processes are inclusive, equitable, and accessible to all learners,
regardless of their background or circumstances.
2.2 Purpose of the Guidelines
These RPL guidelines are designed as a framework aligned with National Credit Framework
(NCrF), not a prescriptive manual, laying down the basic minimum framework with the basic
principles to help Higher Education Institutions/ Universities navigate the complexities of
recognizing prior learning in a standardised manner and with full quality assurance. Rather than
specifying a set of exact methods, the guidelines provide a broad framework, processes and
encourage further exploration and dialogue among stakeholders to address various diverse issues
in the RPL process with this broad framework. The goal is to prompt Higher Education
Institutions (HEIs) to critically evaluate their policies, processes and procedures, ensuring high
quality and standards in RPL throughout the country.
By outlining general principles of good practice in quality assurance, the guidelines promote
reflection and discussion within institutions. The document emphasizes key considerations for
RPL Assessment Centres (RPLACs) at HEIs when developing or refining their approach to
accrediting prior learning and suggesting improvements to current practices. RPL Assessment
Centres are typically associated with Awarding Bodies (AW).
Given their broad scope, these guidelines cater to a diverse audience within the higher education
system. Administrators can use them to validate institutional policies against fundamental
principles, while academic staff can supplement institution-specific documentation with insights
from the framework, informing their roles as educators, program designers, and assessors.
[7
--- Page 13 ---
Higher education institutions, which will serve as enablers for implementing RPL, will develop
their policies, procedures, and practices for recognizing prior learning, reflecting their
organizational structures, goals, and objectives within the broad framework mentioned in these
guidelines. HEIs should, however, carefully evaluate the types and methods of assessment
suitable for evaluating RPL claims in various cases. Additionally, they may assess the suitability
of various assessment tools permitted for evaluating the claims of learning outcomes and
competencies.
2.3 Guidelines as Broad Framework for RPL
These RPL guidelines are designed as a framework aligned with National Credit Framework
(NCrF), not a prescriptive manual, laying down the broad minimum framework with the basic
principles to help Higher Education Institutions/ Universities navigate the complexities of
recognizing prior learning in a standardised manner and with full quality assurance.
Rather than prescribing a specific set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and assessment
methodologies for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), these guidelines offer a broad
framework and processes. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are encouraged to develop their
own detailed SOPs through dialogue and consultation with stakeholders, addressing various
issues and challenges within this framework, and conforming to the National Education Policy
(NEP) and National Credit Framework (NCrF).
The goal is to encourage HEIs to critically create and evaluate their policies, processes, and SOPs
while ensuring high quality and standards in RPL across the country. This approach allows for
flexibility and customization to meet the unique needs of each institution and its learners,
promoting a consistent yet adaptable implementation of RPL nationwide.
By outlining general principles of good practice in quality assurance, the guidelines promote
reflection and discussion within institutions. The document emphasizes key considerations for
RPL Assessment Centres (RPLACs) at HEIs when developing or refining their approach to
accrediting prior learning and suggesting improvements to current practices. RPL Assessment
Centres are typically associated with Awarding Bodies (AW).
Given their broad scope, these guidelines cater to a diverse audience within the higher education
system. Administrators can use them to validate institutional policies against fundamental
principles, while academic staff can supplement institution-specific documentation with insights
from the framework, informing their roles as educators, program designers, and assessors.
Higher education institutions, which will serve as enablers for implementing RPL, will develop
their policies, procedures, and practices for recognizing prior learning, reflecting their
organizational structures, goals, and objectives within the broad framework mentioned in these
guidelines. HEIs should, however, carefully evaluate the types and methods of assessment
suitable for evaluating RPL claims in various cases. Additionally, they may assess the suitability
of various assessment tools permitted for evaluating the claims of learning outcomes and
competencies.

4. RPLin Higher Education: Applicability, Eligibility, and
Creditization
4.1 Applicability
Recognition of Prior Learning allows individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences
(including those from informal or non-formal learning settings) to gain recognition for their
competencies (knowledge, skills, and abilities). This promotes inclusivity by providing pathways
for these individuals to access higher education by offering them the opportunity to formalize
their competencies. There can be three different cases where RPL may be applicable as given
below:
1. Use of RPL for credit earning, accumulation and transfer in Formal education: Credit
transfer is enabled when an individual gets credits from a previous higher education
(university-level) qualification towards attaining a new qualification. Such qualifications
could be either at the same level for a dual degree programme or at a higher level. Credits
are obtained for the learning outcomes achieved through self-learning and/or
work/experiences that relate to the course. This also can be applicable to the outreach
programs run by the HEIs in a formal setup. The SOP for implementation of NCrF in
Higher Education and Vocational Education, Training & Skilling would be applicable in
these cases for such courses/ qualifications. The SOP relating this may be referred through:
https://www.uge.gov.in/pdfnews/0493222 Final-SOP for operationalization of
NCrF in HEI.pdf
2. Prior Certificated learning: This can include professional development and employment-
based awards/ certification, qualifications awarded by a non-Indian higher education
institution, and university courses which a candidate/ student/ learner could not/ did not
complete for some reason.
3. Prior Experiential learning: Prior experiential learning relates to knowledge and skills
one has gained through the work experience in a particular area. These could be
demonstrated through an elaborate process of assessment which can be either a formal
assessment process or via a Hackathon, Olympiad or demonstrating the learning outcomes
from experience gained while working on a startup etc.
4.1.1 RPL for Formal Learning
Formal learning refers to structured educational experiences provided by government-
recognized institutions such as colleges, universities, and accredited entities. The formal
documents obtained from these institutions include:
a) Academic Degrees and Certificates: Awarded upon completion of specific educational
programs, such as bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as diplomas and
certificates.
b) Professional Licenses and Certifications: Obtained through official recognition of
qualifications required for specific professions or industries. They often involve passing
exams and meeting professional standards set by regulatory bodies.
c) Corporate Training Programs: Designed by employers or training providers to enhance
skills and knowledge relevant to specific job roles within organizations. They may
culminate in certificates or certifications recognizing completion and competence.
--- Page 20 ---
d) Continuing Education Programs/Courses: Offered by educational institutions and
professional associations, these courses allow individuals to update their skills or acquire
new ones in their chosen fields. They may lead to certificates or endorsements indicating
completion.
e) Standardized Examinations, including Competitive Examinations: Used to evaluate
individuals' knowledge and skills against established standards. Examples include national
or international standardized tests, entrance exams for higher education, and competitive
exams for employment or admissions to prestigious programs.
Example Use Case: Asha's Journey in Upgrading Qualifications
Asha, a nurse with a Diploma in General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM), seeks to upgrade her
qualifications to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.Sc Nursing) by leveraging Recognition of
Prior Learning (RPL). Here is how her journey unfolds:
i. Submission of Documentation: Asha submits her GNM diploma, detailed transcripts,
course descriptions, and a letter from her employer outlining her roles, responsibilities,
and professional competencies developed during her three years of experience in a large
hospital.
ii. Assessment Process: An assessment body, in collaboration with an awarding body in
the nursing sector, evaluates Asha’s educational background and professional experience.
They compare the curriculum of her GNM program with the courses offered in the B.Sc.
Nursing program, focusing on nursing-related subjects.
iii. Written and Practical Assessments: To demonstrate her competency in nursing, Asha
undergoes written assessments and practical examinations at the RPL Assessment Centre.
These assessments validate her knowledge and skills acquired through her formal
education and work experience. She also submits other documents, such as a portfolio,
experience certificates, and testimonials, for assessment and evaluation.
iv. Credit Awarding through RPL: Based on the assessments, the assessment body
determines the equivalence of Asha’s GNM curriculum with the B.Sc. Nursing program.
They assess whether her previous education and work experience align with the learning
outcomes of specific courses in the B.Sc. Nursing program.
v. Exemption from Courses: With the credits awarded through RPL, Asha can be
exempted from certain courses in the B.Sc Nursing program. This recognition shortens
the duration of her study and reduces her educational expenses.
Application Across Various Disciplines
Similar examples can be developed by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) for liberal arts,
science, technology, and other disciplines. HEIs can create specific guidelines for RPL in various
sectors, enabling individuals to leverage their prior learning and experience for academic and
professional advancement.
4.1.2 RPL for Informal Learning
Informal learning occurs outside formal educational settings and lacks structured delivery by
educational institutions, thus not resulting in formal certification. Since the informal learning is
not delivered formally by an educational institution and not assessed formally by any certificate
awarding body or an assessment agency recognised for the purpose, such learning does not lead
to formal certification. Examples of informal learning may include:
--- Page 21 ---
° Work Experience: Skills and knowledge gained through professional activities.
° Volunteering: Practical experience acquired through unpaid work.
° Self-Taught Skills: Knowledge obtained through independent study and practice.
° Hobbies and Personal Projects: Competencies developed through personal
interests and activities.
° Mentorship and Coaching: Learning through guidance from experienced
individuals.
° Participation in Clubs and Groups: Skills and knowledge gained through social
and community involvement.
Example Use Case: Suresh's Journey to an MBA
Suresh, an entrepreneur with over eight years of experience running a local retail business, seeks
to leverage RPL to accelerate his pursuit of an MBA (Master of Business Administration). Here’s
how his informal learning journey unfolds:
iii.
Preparation of Portfolio: Suresh compiles a comprehensive portfolio detailing his
business operations, including financial records, marketing strategies, and summaries of
his self-study materials. He includes testimonials from business partners, suppliers, and
clients to substantiate his practical knowledge and achievements.
Assessment Process: An RPL Assessment Body reviews Suresh’s portfolio to evaluate
his understanding of business management concepts relevant to the MBA curriculum. They
assess how his real-world experience aligns with theoretical frameworks taught in MBA
courses.
Interview and Case Studies: As part of the assessment, Suresh participates in an
interview where he discusses his business practices and presents case studies from his
operations. This allows him to demonstrate his application of theoretical business concepts
in real-world scenarios.
Credit Awarding through RPL: Based on the portfolio review, interview outcomes, and
case study presentations, the Assessment Body determines that Suresh’s informal learning
provides a substantial foundation in core business areas covered by the MBA program.
They award him credits for these areas.
Exemption from Certain Courses: With the credits awarded through RPL, Suresh is
exempted from certain courses in the MBA program. This recognition allows him to
complete his degree more quickly and with reduced expenses, focusing on areas where he
needs to deepen his knowledge or explore new perspectives.
By leveraging RPL, individuals like Suresh can translate their informal learning into formal
educational achievements, accelerating their academic and professional advancement.
4.1.3 RPL for Non formal learning
Non-formal learning refers to organized and structured learning that is intentional from the
learner's perspective but does not necessarily lead to formal certification or accreditation. It
typically occurs outside traditional educational institutions but involves systematic learning,
instruction, or training. Examples include:
° Workshops
. Short Courses
--- Page 22 ---
° Professional Development Programs
° Community Education
° Self-Study
° Online Courses and Webinars
° Company Training Programs
° Arts and Sports Training
° Youth Groups
° Scout Programs
Example Use Case: Vinay's Journey to a Master's in Environmental Science
Vinay, who has extensive experience in environmental conservation through his work at an
NGO, aims to pursue a Master's program (MSc) in Environmental Science. Here’s how RPL
supports his educational journey:
iii.
Preparation of Portfolio: Vinay compiles a detailed portfolio including certificates from
structured training sessions, descriptions of workshops attended, and letters of
recommendation from workshop leaders and his current employer. He also includes a
Statement of Purpose (SOP) outlining how his non-formal education and skills can be
applied in professional settings.
Assessment Process: An RPL assessment evaluates the relevance of Vinay's non-formal
education and experiences against the curriculum of the Master's program in
Environmental Science. The focus is on aligning the learning outcomes of his training
sessions with the academic requirements of the MSc program.
Interview and Presentation: Vinay participates in an interview where he presents his
experiences and non-formal learnings related to environmental conservation. He
demonstrates his understanding of environmental science concepts by presenting case
studies from his work experience, highlighting how theoretical knowledge has been applied
in practical scenarios.
Credit Awarding through RPL: Based on the portfolio review, interview outcomes, and
case study presentations, Vinay is awarded credits for courses related to Environmental
Policy that align closely with his non-formal learning. These credits exempt him from
certain courses within the Master's program.
Exemption from Courses: With the credits recognized through RPL, Vinay is exempted
from completing specific courses in Environmental Policy as part of his MSc program.
This recognition streamlines his educational path, reducing both the time required to
complete his degree and the associated costs.
By leveraging RPL, individuals like Vinay can translate their non-formal learning into formal
educational achievements, facilitating their academic and professional advancement.
4.2 Eligibility Criteria
The eligibility criteria for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) typically include the following
parameters/ Criterion:
a) Relevant Prior Learning Experience: The prior learning or experience must be
pertinent to the program or qualification for which RPL is sought. Candidates need

their prior learning by qualified assessors. This may involve participating in
interviews, examinations, portfolio assessments, practical demonstrations, or other
assessment methods as required by the institution or program.
4.3
Principle of creditization
The principle of creditization ensures that all forms of learning—whether formal, informal, or
non-formal—are recognized and converted into credits that contribute to a degree or
certification. This principle is fundamental for creating an inclusive education system that values
diverse learning experiences. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) supports the creditization
of every hour of learning, regardless of type, level, or delivery mode. The key aspects and
recommendations for effective creditization are as under:
Comprehensive Recognition of Learning:
e Recognize all types of learning, including formal education, workplace training,
experiential learning, self-study, and community-based learning. This ensures that
students' varied experiences and skills are acknowledged and valued.
Clearly defined learning outcomes for Outcome-Based Credit Awarding:
° Credits should be awarded based on the assessment of learning outcomes rather than
the duration or type of learning. This ensures that the credits reflect the actual
knowledge, skills, and competencies acquired by the learner.
Alignment with National Frameworks:
e The creditization process should align with national frameworks such as the NCrF,
the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Higher
Education Qualifications Framework (NHEQF). These frameworks provide
standardized levels and criteria for assignment of NCrF levels based on the level
descriptors as well as assignment of credits.
--- Page 24 ---
Transparent and Consistent Policies for assessment processes for award of credits:
e Institutions should establish transparent and consistent policies for assessment
processes for RPL creditization. These policies should clearly define the criteria for
awarding credits, the assessment methods used, and the maximum credits that can be
earned through different types of learning.
Flexibility in the assessment for Creditization Process:
e The assessment for creditization process for recognizing prior learning (RPL) should
be flexible to accommodate the diverse needs of learners with RPL providing
opportunities for them to demonstrate their competencies through various assessment
methods.
Institutional Autonomy:
e While adhering to the national frameworks and standards, including National Credit
Framework (NCrF) and these guidelines, the institutions have the autonomy to
develop and implement their assessment policies. This allows them to tailor the
process to their specific programs and student/ learner populations.
Integration with Career Development:
e Ensure that the assessment and credits earned through various forms of learning
contribute to the learner's overall career development. This includes aligning the
assessment and credits with professional standards and industry requirements.
Continuous Improvement and Feedback:
e Establish mechanisms for continuous improvement and feedback in the assessment
and creditization process. Regularly review and update the policies to reflect evolving
educational standards and learner needs.
Support and Guidance for Learners:
e Provide learners with support and guidance throughout the assessment and
creditization process. This includes offering counseling services to help them
understand how their prior learning can be creditised and what additional learning or
up-skilling they may need to achieve their goals.
Promotion of Lifelong Learning:
e Encourage lifelong learning by recognizing the prior learning and creditising learning
at all stages of life through proper assessment. This promotes continuous personal
and professional development.
Technological Integration:
e Utilize technology to streamline the assessment and creditization process. Implement
digital platforms for submitting and assessing evidence of learning, tracking credits,
and providing learners with easy access to their APAAR iDs & Academic Bank of
Credits (ABC) records.
12. Collaboration with Stakeholders:
e Foster collaboration between educational institutions, employers, industry bodies,
and government agencies to ensure that the assessment and creditization process
meets the needs, standards of all stakeholders.
By implementing these principles, the assessment and creditization process can become a robust
and inclusive system that values and leverages diverse learning experiences, ultimately
contributing to a more skilled and competent workforce.
--- Page 25 ---
5. Process for RPL in Higher Education
5.1
Stages of RPL in Higher Education
The process of RPL can be detailed in five major stages:
Stage 1: Awareness, Information, and Guidance
Before enrolling, potential learners should be informed about the possibility of
claiming credits for previous learning based on the assessment of pre-defined learning
outcomes.
Interested learners need detailed information about the RPL process, pre-defined
learning outcomes, NCrF Level, number of credits assigned for RPL, assessment
method to be used including available support and guidance, timelines, appeals
processes, and any associated fees etc.
Stage 2: Pre-Assessment for Gathering Evidence and Providing Information
Learners begin by collecting evidence that meets the requirements of the relevant
unit(s).
Developing and explaining an assessment plan and tracking document may be
necessary to support the learner.
The collected evidence must align with the standards of the unit or part of the unit it
is being used for.
Stage 3: Assessment and Documentation of Evidence
RPL assessment process involves a structured process of gathering, reviewing
evidence, and making judgments about a learner’s prior learning and experience in
relation to learning unit standards.
For the purpose of assessment a properly planned assessor who has full understanding
of the assessment process and the domain must be assigned for carrying out the
assessment.
Assessors may review the work experience records validated by managers, previous
portfolios, essays, reports validated by a competent authority as being the learners
own unaided work, or proof of competitive examinations (e.g., UPSC, CUET, GATE)
as may be authorized by UGC from time to time.
The assessment must be aligned with the pre prescribed assessment method and the
processes, valid and reliable to ensure the integrity of the credit awarded.
Standard quality assurance procedures, such as internal standardization and
verification, storing of digital evidence of proper assessment, which may include
video clips etc will apply.
Evidence should be clearly referenced and signposted for internal and external
verification.
RPL can also account for non-academic experiences, such as projects, papers,
experiments, informal learning (e.g., YouTube, podcasts), or micro-credits earned
which must be based on a predefined criteria and methodology for assessment.
--- Page 26 ---
° At this stage, the need for any bridging courses or upskilling will be identified and
provided to the learners. The institution may also offer them such bridge courses or
upskilling qualifications. Alternatively the institution may make arrangements for
such additional learning in collaboration with partners.
Stage 4: Claiming Certification
° After successful completion of internal and external quality assurance procedures,
and assessment the center can make certification claims in case the learner has
exhibited that he/she has achieved the learning outcomes prescribed for such
certification.
° All assessment and internal verification records, along with any additional RPL
records, should be retained for three years following RPL certification.
° Assessors must ensure all learning outcomes and assessment criteria for each unit are
met, maintaining proper records of assessment.
Stage 5: Appeal
° Students can appeal against an assessment decision by submitting a formal written
request highlighting specific the reasons are one thing out errors and including the
supporting documentation thereof.
By following these stages, the RPL process ensures that learners' prior experiences and learning
are effectively recognized and credited, contributing to their educational and professional
advancement.
The overview of the RPL process is shown in Figure 3.

5.2
Principles of assessment in RPL
In assessing prior learning, the following criteria are considered:
a.
Acceptability: Is there a suitable alignment between the evidence presented and the
pre-defined learning outcomes being demonstrated? Is the evidence both valid and reliable?
This should be consistent with the industry standards, the global standards or standards
prescribed by professional, statutory, or regulatory bodies, and with the guidelines issued
under NCrF.
Sufficiency: Is there enough evidence to fully demonstrate the achievement of the claimed
learning outcomes at the claimed NCrF levels. This aspect is also guided by the predefined
learning outcomes based on the level descriptors and the suggested assessment
methodology.
Authenticity and Relevance: Is the evidence connected to the applicant's efforts and
accomplishments? It's the evidence lined with the subject or course or qualification or
learning outcome for which the assessment and certification is being claimed by the learner.
Currency: Does the evidence pertain to current learning? If there are specific requirements
or time limits for the currency of evidence, certification, or demonstration of learning set
by Higher Education (HE) Institutions and/or professional, statutory, or regulatory bodies,
these should be transparently communicated.
Assessment should be done to evaluate a learner's competencies including knowledge and skills
against predetermined criteria to determine their level of achievement. A document outlining the
assessment methods, criteria, timelines, and responsibilities for evaluating and recognizing prior
learning within a specific program or qualification should be developed by the assessment body.
Assessment methods should align with the evidence presented, ensuring suitability and should
be transparent and well defined

The assessment methodology and tools for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) should include
the following components:
1. Portfolio of Evidence:
° Candidates should compile a portfolio showcasing their prior learning and
achievements.
° Guidance on portfolio preparation should address various aspects, such as the scope
and depth of evidence, its relevance, currency, and the need for independent
verification if necessary.
2. Focused Interview or Viva:
e A structured interview or viva can help assessors understand the candidate's
knowledge and experiences in greater depth.
3. Completion of a Piece of Work:
° Candidates may be asked to complete a specific piece of work relevant to the module,
course, or program for which they seek equivalence.
4. Reflective Account/ Diary:
e A reflective account or learning diary detailing the learning achieved can provide
insights into the candidate's learning process and outcomes.
5. Standard Assessment:
° Candidates may also be required to complete the usual assessments used in the
module, course, or program to demonstrate the achievement of predefined learning
outcomes.
To ensure a fair and consistent evaluation, HEIs should develop a structured scoring guide or
framework for assessors. This guide should evaluate the quality, relevance, and completeness of
the evidence presented in learners' RPL portfolios.
By incorporating these methodologies and tools, the RPL assessment process can effectively
validate the prior learning and experiences of candidates, ensuring they meet the required
standards for their desired qualifications.
5.3 Applying for RPL
The process of applying for RPL by a candidate desirous of doing so must pass through the initial
process of application and portfolio development as detailed in section 5.5.2
5.3.1 Application guidelines
Prospective candidates express their interest in seeking recognition of their prior learning by
applying and providing relevant documentation, such as transcripts, certificates, diplomas,
degrees, work experience records, apprenticeship, project work, industrial project, working on a
start-up, and other evidence of prior learning.
Stage 1: Awareness, Information, and Guidance
Before enrolling, potential learners should be informed about the possibility of claiming credits
and the NCrF level at which such credits could be claimed for their previous learning. If they are
interested, they need to know:
e The applicability of RPL.
e The process for claiming achievements using RPL.
--- Page 30 ---
e Available sources of support and guidance.
e Timelines, appeals processes, and any fees involved.
Stage 2: Pre-Assessment — Gathering Evidence and Providing Information
At this stage, the learner collects evidence that meets the requirements of the relevant learning
unit(s). This may involve developing an assessment plan for assessing the learning outcomes and
tracking document to support the learner. The gathered evidence must align with the standards
of the unit or part of the unit it is intended for.
Stage 3: Assessment and Documentation of Evidence
Assessment in RPL involves a structured process for gathering and reviewing evidence and
making judgments about a learner’s prior learning and experience in relation to unit standards.
The assessor may review:
° Work experience records validated by managers.
° Previous portfolios of evidence compiled by the learner.
° Essays and reports validated as the learner’s own unaided work.
° Proof of passing competitive examinations such as UPSC, CUET, or GATE,
authorized by UGC.
The assessment must be valid and reliable to ensure the integrity of the credit awarded. The
evidence must meet the unit standards, and the assessment process will follow standard quality
assurance procedures, including internal standardization and verification. Evidence gathered
through RPL should be clearly referenced and signposted to aid internal and external verification.
By following these stages, the RPL process ensures that learners' prior experiences and learning
are effectively recognized and credited, contributing to their educational and professional
advancement.
5.3.2 Portfolio Development
Candidates compile an assessment portfolio containing evidence of their prior learning, which
may include transcripts, certificates, diplomas, degrees, work samples, projects, and other
relevant documentation. This evidence is assessed against the learning outcomes of a module or
qualification, either partially or fully.
To assist learners in developing their RPL portfolios, a comprehensive guide or handbook should
be provided, offering step-by-step instructions, examples, and tips for compiling evidence and
writing reflections. Clear and specific guidelines should also be provided on the types of
evidence that can be submitted, including examples, formats, and documentation requirements.
The following steps outline the process for developing a prior learning assessment portfolio:
i. Understand RPL Requirements: Familiarize yourself with the requirements and
guidelines provided by the institution or organization offering RPL. Understand what types
of prior learning experiences are eligible for credit.
ii Identify Learning Outcomes: Review the learning outcomes or competencies of the
course or program for which credit is being sought. Identify which prior learning
experiences are relevant.
iii, Gather Documentation: Collect documentation that supports your prior learning
experiences. This may include certificates, transcripts, work samples, letters of
recommendation, and other relevant materials. Organize these documents neatly.
--- Page 31 ---
vi.
vii.
viii.
Xi.
Reflect on Learning: Reflect on each prior learning experience and how it aligns with the
learning outcomes of the course or program. Consider the knowledge, skills, and
competencies acquired and how they relate to the academic context.
Create Written Narratives: Write narratives or reflective essays for each prior learning
experience. Describe what you learned, how you learned it, and how it applies to the course
or program for which you are seeking credit.
Organize Portfolio Sections: Organize your portfolio into sections based on learning
outcomes or competencies. Arrange the documentation and written narratives in a logical
order that makes it easy for reviewers to assess your prior learning.
Review and Revise: Carefully review your portfolio to ensure it meets all requirements
and guidelines. Revise as needed to clarify the learning experiences and their relevance to
the course or program.
Seek Feedback: Seek feedback from advisors, mentors, or instructors familiar with RPL
portfolios. They can provide valuable insights and suggestions for improvement.
Submit Portfolio: Submit your RPL portfolio according to the institution's instructions.
Be sure to include any required forms or documentation.
Prepare for Assessment: Be prepared for the assessment process, which may involve
interviews, examinations, or presentations to further demonstrate your prior learning.
Follow Up: Follow up with the institution after submitting the portfolio to track the
progress of your assessment. Be prepared to provide additional information or clarification
if requested.
Evaluation and Outcomes
° Systematic Evaluation: A systematic evaluation of the learner's RPL portfolio will
be conducted by trained assessors or evaluators to determine its alignment with
program requirements and learning outcomes, as well as its overall quality and
completeness.
° Documentation of Outcomes: Assessors will submit a document summarizing the
outcomes of the learner's RPL accreditation application. This document will include
details of credits awarded, qualifications achieved, and any additional
recommendations or feedback provided.
By following these steps, learners can effectively compile and submit their RPL assessment
portfolios, ensuring their prior learning and experiences are recognized and credited towards
their academic and professional goals.

6. Assessment for RPL
6.1 Types of Assessments
The assessment process for Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) involves several key steps:
i. Portfolio Assessment: Candidates create a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating their
knowledge, skills, and experiences related to the subject area. This portfolio may include
work samples, projects, coursework, certificates, and reflective writing.
ii Standardized Exams: Candidates take exams or standardized tests, approved and
authorized by UGC, to assess their knowledge and competencies in specific subject areas
or courses. These tests are designed to evaluate the learning outcomes of particular
programs or courses.
iii, Interviews or Oral Examinations: Candidates participate in structured interviews or oral
examinations with subject-matter experts or faculty members. This method allows for a
direct assessment of the candidate's knowledge, communication skills, and ability to apply
concepts.
iv. Skills Demonstrations or Simulations: Candidates perform specific tasks, simulations,
or practical demonstrations related to the subject area. This method is particularly useful
for assessing practical skills, problem-solving abilities, and real-world applications.
v. Product or Project Evaluation: Candidates submit work samples, projects, or products
they have created, which are evaluated by subject-matter experts for their quality, depth of
understanding, and application of relevant knowledge and skills.
Evolving Assessment Methods
Additional types of assessments may be developed over time based on the monitoring and review
processes detailed in the report.
Weightage of Assessment Categories
The RPL assessment committee will determine the weightage given to each category of
assessment to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation of the candidate's prior learning.
For recognition of prior learning National Council for Vocational Education and Training
(NCVET) Has also notified detailed guidelines which are fully compliant with National Credit
Framework (NCrF) and National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF). The institutions may
also see these guidelines for further details.
6.2 Methods of Assessments and Creditization
Assessment should evaluate a learner's knowledge, skills, and competencies against
predetermined criteria, such as learning outcomes, to determine their level of achievement. The
Awarding/Assessment body should develop a document outlining the assessment methods,
criteria, timelines, and responsibilities for evaluating and recognizing prior learning within a
specific program or qualification. Assessment methods should align with the evidence presented,
ensuring suitability, and the criteria for assessment must be transparent and well-defined.
Assessment Tools
Assessment tools should include:
i. Portfolio of Evidence: Candidates compile a portfolio demonstrating their prior learning
and achievements. This may include work samples, projects, coursework, certificates, and
reflective writing. Guidance on portfolio preparation should address scope, depth,
relevance, currency, and the need for independent verification of evidence.
--- Page 33 ---
iii.
Focused Interview or Viva: Structured interviews or oral examinations with subject-
matter experts or faculty members to assess the candidate's knowledge, communication
skills, and ability to apply concepts.
Completion of Work and Reflective Account/Diary: Candidates complete specific tasks,
projects, or reflective writing to demonstrate their learning and how it applies to the
module/course/program for which equivalence is being claimed.
Usual Assessment Methods: Candidates may complete standard assessments used in the
module, course, or program to show their achievement of predefined learning outcomes.
Assessment Framework and Documentation
v.
vi.
Structured Scoring Guide and Framework: A structured document with a scoring guide
and assessment framework should be used by assessors to evaluate the quality, relevance,
and completeness of the evidence presented in learners' RPL portfolios. Institutes planning
to implement RPL assessment should develop this guide.
Governance and Record Keeping: A complete record of the RPL process should be
maintained to ensure transparency and governance. This includes documentation of all
steps in the assessment process and the evidence used for evaluation.
By following these guidelines, the RPL assessment process can be effectively managed, ensuring
that learners' prior experiences and learning are recognized and credited towards their academic
and professional goals.
6.3. Assessment Process
The following methods, or a combination of methods, may be used in the RPL assessment
process:
A.
1.
Tests and Examinations
Description: Candidates demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions in a test or
examination related to a specific field or area of study.

relevant skill sets.
2. Format: Equate examination learning outcomes with appropriate qualifications and define
the credits that may be earned, aligned with the NCrF level.
Final assessment may be exempted for such students by the regulatory authority. The list of such
competitive examinations may be periodically notified by UGC.
Recommendations
° Credits should be awarded only when adequate information about the assessment of
prior learning is available, ensuring it meets established criteria.
° Approval from the program director or an appropriate committee is required, who
will take responsibility for the final decision.
° Descriptions of industry best practices for assessment can be found in the blended
learning guidelines issued by the National Council for Vocational Education and
Training.
6.4 Assessment Bodies and Centers
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is essential for promoting lifelong learning and validating
non-formal and informal learning. Assessment bodies play a crucial role in helping individuals
gain formal recognition for their skills and knowledge, which facilitates career advancement and
ensures that education and training systems meet the needs of both learners and the labor market.
--- Page 35 ---
Key Responsibilities of Assessment Bodies in RPL:
1.
Equitable Access: Ensure that RPL assessments are accessible to all individuals, including
those from marginalized or non-traditional backgrounds.
Clear Standards: Establish and maintain clear standards for RPL assessments to ensure
consistency and transparency.
Quality Assurance: Implement robust quality assurance mechanisms to guarantee the
fairness, reliability, and validity of assessments.
Lifelong Learning Facilitation: Support the concept of lifelong learning by recognizing
a wide range of learning experiences, whether formal, non-formal, or informal.
By adhering to these basic principles, the assessment bodies can effectively contribute to the
professional growth of individuals and the overall responsiveness of education and training
systems to evolving labour market demands.
6.4.1 RPL Assessment Bodies
Degree-awarding bodies in higher education in India, include a mix of institutions recognized at
the Central level, State level and Awarding Bodies recognised by NCVET can carry RPL
assessment. Such Institutions can be used to evaluate and creditise candidates for prior learning
and award credits for the same:
I
II.
IIL.
IV.
Institutes of National Importance (INI): The INIs like IITs, NITs, NID, IITs, IIMs, IISERs
may etc. are premier public higher education institution in India established by an act
of Parliament of India and recognised as an institution which "serves as a pivotal player in
developing highly skilled personnel within the specified region of the country/state".
Institutes of National Importance (INI) receive special recognition, higher autonomy and
funding from the Government of India with the power to hold examinations, grant degrees,
diplomas and other academic distinctions or titles. All the INIs falling under the purview
of UGC/AICTE/other Ministry/regulator may be considered to conduct RPL program.
All universities and HEIs for which Hon’ble President of India is the visitor, or the Hon’ble
vice-president of India is the chancellor.
Central Universities are Universities covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which
regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc. These Universities like JNU, University
of Delhi, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University can be considered for
conduct of RPL programs, keeping in mind their history, reputation and credibility.
In certain cases, institutions recognized and notified as Deemed Universities/ Autonomous
Colleges by the Government of India on the recommendations of the UGC/AICTE may
also be considered for allowing to conduct RPL programs.
Implementation and Governance: These institutions must:
° Formally set up RPL Committees to carry out RPL assessments and maintain the
prescribed evidence to support audits and governance improvements.
° Make details of the committees, courses/ programs covered by RPL, and the students/
learners who received RPL certification available on their websites.
By adhering to these guidelines, these institutions can effectively conduct RPL assessments,
ensuring transparency and maintaining high standards in recognizing prior learning.
--- Page 36 ---
6.4.2 Government recognised centres for RPL
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) processes can be managed at the institutional level by
various autonomous universities and colleges recognized by the government. It is proposed to
establish government-recognized centers for RPL assessment, creditization, and appropriate
credit mapping. Given the wide range of universities across India recognized by the government,
some of these institutions may be designated as government-recognized centers for RPL.
i.
iii.
State Universities: These universities operate within individual states and are funded and
managed by state governments.
Central Universities: These universities are established by acts of Parliament and are
managed by the central government.
Deemed Universities: These institutions are granted autonomy and status by the
Department of Higher Education, under the Ministry of Education, on the advice of the
University Grants Commission (UGC).
Private Universities: These are established through state or central legislation and are
managed privately but recognized by the government.
Awarding Bodies Recognized by NCVET: These bodies are recognized by the National
Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) and may also be identified as
centers for RPL.
Proposed Centers for RPL and Implementation
° The government will identify certain institutions from the above categories to serve
as recognized centers for RPL assessment.
° These centers will handle the evaluation, creditization, and mapping of credits for
prior learning.
° Institutions chosen as RPL centers must adhere to the established guidelines and
standards for assessing prior learning.
° They will provide services to ensure that learners' prior knowledge and experiences
are formally recognized and credited towards their qualifications.
By designating specific universities and awarding bodies as recognized centers for RPL, the
government can ensure a standardized and efficient process for recognizing prior learning across
the country.

7. Credit Assignment and Relevance to Higher Education Program
7.1 | Curriculum to Learning outcome Mapping
Curriculum/ course/ subject/ syllabus mapping is the process of determining how the current
requirements of the programme support the achievement of the learning outcome goals. Before
assessing prior learning, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the learning outcomes of
the programme. The prescribed Learning outcomes articulate what a student should know,
understand, and be able to do upon completion of the programme.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) envisages a learning outcomes-based curricular
framework for all programmes of study both at UG and PG levels. Programme Learning
Outcomes (PLOs) lead to the attainment of the graduate attributes, and Course Learning
Outcomes (CLOs) additionally lead to the achievement of the Programme Learning Outcomes.
It also helps in:
i) an increased focus on the attainment of the expected graduate attributes by students
ii) designing a teaching-learning experience that enables students to achieve the expected
graduate attributes and defined PLOs/ CLOs
iii) designing learning assessment methods/ processes/ procedures that help assess progress
towards achievement by the students of the expected CLOs/ PLOs and the prescribed
graduate attributes.

Table: 2 Structured programme Learning Outcome (PLO) and actions required for curriculum mapping
The National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) envisages that students on
completion of a programme of study must possess and demonstrate the expected graduate
attributes. Graduate attributes include learning outcomes that are specific to disciplinary areas
--- Page 38 ---
relating to the chosen field(s) of learning within broad multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary/
transdisciplinary contexts.
The graduate profile/ attributes are acquired incrementally and describe a set of competencies
(knowledge, skills and abilities) fostered through meaningful learning experiences made
available through the curriculum and learning experience, the total college/university experience,
and a process of critical and reflective thinking.
Within the broad contours of learning outcomes, the NHEQF also prescribes the learning
outcomes of UG certificate (1 year of UG), UG Diploma (24 year of UG), UG degree (3" year
UG), UG (Hons. and Hons. with Research), PG Diploma, Master's and Doctoral degree.
The learning outcomes of a programme are attained by learners through the essential learnings
acquired on completion of selected courses of study within a programme. Course learning
outcomes are specific to the learning for a given course of study related to a disciplinary or
interdisciplinary/multi-disciplinary area. The achievement by students of course-level learning
outcomes leads to the attainment of the programme learning outcomes.
At the course level, each course may well have links to some but not all graduate attributes as
these are developed through the totality of student learning experiences across the years of their
study. A course map would indicate the linkage between course learning outcomes and each
programme learning outcome, as shown in Table 3:

Table 3: Mapping the Courses with the Learning Outcomes
Course-level learning outcomes will be aligned to programme learning outcomes. Course- level
learning outcomes are specific to a course of study within a given programme of study.
It is the responsibility of the concerned Higher Education Institutes to notify the learning
outcomes of the program for the RPL. The HEIs must also prepare methodologies to assess
the defined leaning outcomes. RPL should not be used for any learning
unit/course/programme if the Learning Outcomes (LO) for that are NOT clearly defined.
7.2 Matching of RPL with Learning Outcomes of the program
The HEIs will take appropriate action in identifying and mapping the relevant skills, knowledge,
and competencies acquired through prior learning experiences to the learning outcomes of the
programme. Course-level learning outcomes will be aligned with programme learning outcomes.
These outcomes are specific to a particular course within a broader programme of study.
It is the responsibility of the relevant HEIs to establish and communicate the learning outcomes
for RPL. Additionally, HEIs must develop methodologies to assess the specified learning
outcomes. RPL should not be applied to any learning unit, course, or programme, if its Learning
Outcomes (LOs) are not clearly defined.

7.3 Mapping of Learning outcomes with the credits
It is essential to link the RPL process to the National Credit Framework. which is an inclusive
umbrella framework designed to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school education,
higher education, and vocational and skill education. For the creditization and integration of all
learning, the NCrF encompasses the qualification frameworks developed for higher education,
vocational and skill education, and school education. These include the National Higher
Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), the National Skills Qualification Framework
(NSQF), and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF), also known as
the National Curricular Framework (NCF).
In the Higher Education context, the UGC outlines the total number of credits required for
completion of an undergraduate programme. The distribution of credits among different
components of the curriculum, such as core courses, elective courses, and additional
requirements, has been specified.

Table 6: Description of UG Course Certification
--- Page 42 ---
The credit accumulation in the context of RPL has to integrate itself into the basic structure as
outlined through the NHEQF of UGC. Since the HEI have the autonomy to decide the teaching
learning process based on the suggested instructional hours, it has to evolve a strategy through
its statutory authorities on integrating the RPL assessment process and creditizing the same after
a robust assessment process. The credits earned by the learners through RPL will be credited to
the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). This will facilitate the learners to further integrate the
acquired credits through the RPL and meet the additional required credits to be earned for award
of a certificate/diploma/degree.
The committee recommends that to start with up to 30% of credits for programs may be
obtained through RPL
For operationalizing the process following scenarios may be helpful:
Scenario 1: Diploma programme of 40 credits
Regular Course Credits = 40 credits X 0.7 = 28 credits RPL Credits = 40 credits X 0.3 = 12
credits
So, in this scenario: Regular Course Credits: 28 credits and RPL Credits: 12 credits
Scenario 2: 3-year Undergraduate course of 120 credits, and we want to allocate 70% of the
credits for the regular course and reserve 30% for RPL, you would calculate it as follows:
Regular Course Credits: 120 credits x 0.7 = 84 credits
RPL Credits: 120 credits x 0.3 = 36 credits
So, in this scenario: Regular Course Credits: 84 credits and RPL Credits: 36 credits
Scenario 3: 4-year undergraduate course with 160 credits, and we want to allocate 70% of the
credits for the regular course and reserve 30% for RPL, we would calculate it as follows:
Regular Course Credits: 160 credits x 0.7=112 credits
RPL Credits: 160 credits x 0.3 = 48 credits
So, in this scenario: Regular Course Credits: 112 credits RPL Credits: 48 credits
In case any HEI wants to allow more than 30% of credits via RPL, it may explicitly take
approval from UGC for the same in accordance with other important guidelines of UGC.
A comparison table in this regard has been attached in Annexure 2 for reference
7.3.1 Level of the learning in relation to the credit framework and how these
maps to the relevant Programme
RPL assessments are typically conducted on an individual basis, considering the unique
experiences, skills, and knowledge of each student. The maximum credit assignment may vary
depending on the relevance, depth, and currency of the learner's prior learning in relation to the
degree programme. Institutions should have clear policies and procedures outlining the
maximum credit assignment for RPL, as well as the criteria and evidence required for
assessment. While operationalizing the process the following should be kept in mind:
(i) Level of Learning:
a. Input Qualification for a learning: The framework also define the minimum
skill/qualification the learner has before doing the course.
--- Page 43 ---
b. Credit and Qualifications Framework: The framework typically defines various
levels of learning, often numbered, or named (e.g., levels (1-8) in the National Skill
Qualifications Framework and Levels (4.5-8) in the National Higher Education
Qualifications Framework).
c. Relation to University Credit: Each level of learning corresponds to a specific
amount of credit earned upon successful completion of learning outcomes. For
example, a level 4 module might be worth 10 credits, while a level 5 module might
be worth 20 credits, and so on.
(ii) Mapping to the Relevant Programme: The HEI shall have to map the credits earned by
a learner in consonance with the typical nature of the programme. For example- the
Cosmetology Diploma Programme would typically be designed to align with a specific
level within the Credit and Qualifications Framework as prescribed under a job role of the
industry as outlined in the National Skill Qualification Framework and available on
National Qualification Register.
(iii) Learning Outcomes: The learning outcomes of the programme would be mapped to the
corresponding level within the framework. For instance, foundational skills and knowledge
might be associated with lower levels, while more advanced or specialized skills would
align with higher levels.
(iv) Credits: Each module or unit within a programme would be assigned a certain number of
credits based on its level within the framework. This allocation reflects the expected
learning intensity and depth associated with each component of the programme.
While doing so the following example of the Cosmetology programme may be of useful:
Let us say the Cosmetology (Craft Instructor) programme is designed to align with level 5 of the
NSQF.
Level of Learning: Level 5
Credits: The programme comprises 40 credits in total, with each module typically worth a
certain number of credits based on its level of complexity and expected workload.
Mapping to Programme: Learning outcomes for hair styling, makeup application, skin care
procedures, etc., are designed to meet the expectations of level 5 learning. Each module within
the programme is structured to ensure coherence and progression towards achieving the desired
competencies at this level.
7.4 Credit Transfer to Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) must ensure that Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
assessments maintain academic rigor and uphold the integrity of their degree programs. To
achieve this, the following guidelines should be considered:
1. Maximum Credit Assignment:
e The maximum number of credits awarded through RPL should strike a balance
between recognizing prior learning and ensuring students meet the program's learning
outcomes and standards.
° Some institutions may impose limits on the maximum number of credits that can be
awarded through RPL for a specific degree program. These limits help maintain the
academic integrity of the program and ensure that students engage sufficiently with
the curriculum.
--- Page 44 ---
2. Alignment with Learning Outcomes:
e The maximum credit assignment for RPL should align with the learning outcomes of
the degree program.
e Institutions should provide a degree of flexibility to accommodate the typical needs
of learners as well as program requirements as outlined by statutory bodies.
3. Credit Transfer and Tracking:
e When transferring credits to the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for those obtained
via RPL, the method should be clearly labeled as RPL. This will help the degree-
awarding institution ensure that no more than 30% of credits for a degree are obtained
through RPL.
By adhering to these guidelines, HEIs can ensure that RPL assessments are rigorous and that the
integrity of their degree programs is maintained while still recognizing and valuing the prior
learning of their students.
7.5 Maximum Credit assignment via RPL in HE degree
Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) must ensure that Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
assessments maintain academic rigor and uphold the integrity of their degree programs. The
following guidelines should be considered:
1. Balancing Credit Assignment:
e The maximum number of credits awarded through RPL should reflect a balance
between recognizing prior learning and ensuring that students meet the program's
learning outcomes and standards.
° Some institutions may impose limits on the maximum number of credits that can be
awarded through RPL for a specific degree program. These limits help maintain the
academic integrity of the program and ensure that students engage sufficiently with
the curriculum.
2. Alignment with Learning Outcomes:
e The maximum credit assignment for RPL should align with the learning outcomes of
the degree program.
e The maximum percentage of credits that may be acquired through RPL shall be up to
30%.
3. Flexibility for HEIs:
e A certain amount of flexibility can be given to HEIs to accommodate the typical needs
of learners as well as the program requirements as outlined by statutory bodies.
By adhering to these guidelines, HEIs can ensure that RPL assessments are rigorous and that the
integrity of their degree programs is maintained while still recognizing and valuing the prior
learning of their students.
7.6 Credit Assignment & Relevance to the University Programme
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommended restructuring degree programs to
include various durations for undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The National Credit
Framework (NCrF) and the National Higher Education Qualifications Framework (NHEQF)
have organized qualifications at different levels based on the complexity of learning outcomes,
ranging from level 4.5 to level 8. The key points are as follows:
--- Page 45 ---
1. Credit Framework:
Each level requires a minimum of 40 credits as prescribed by the NCrF.
2. Undergraduate Programme Requirements:
A 3-year undergraduate program requires a minimum of 120 credits.
A 4-year undergraduate program requires a minimum of 160 credits.
The details are listed in the table below:
NHEQF | Examples of higher education qualifications located within Credit
Level each level Requirements
(Minimum)
Level 4.5 | Undergraduate Certificate. Programme duration: First year 40
(first two semesters) of the undergraduate programme,
followed by an exit 4-credit skills-enhancement course(s).
Level 5 | Undergraduate Diploma. Programme duration: First two years 80

7.6.1Principle of Creditization for All Types of Learning
The principle of creditization ensures that all forms of learning—whether formal, informal, or
non-formal—are recognized and converted into credits that contribute to a degree, diploma or
certification. This principle is fundamental for creating an inclusive education system that values
diverse learning experiences.
The National Credit Framework (NCrF) provides for the creditization of every hour of learning,
regardless of type, level, or delivery mode. This includes formal education, workplace training,
self-study, and community-based learning, ensuring that students! varied experiences and skills
are acknowledged and valued.
The creditization process should align with national frameworks such as the NCrF, the National
Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF), and the National Higher Education Qualifications
Framework (NHEQF).
Following are the basic Principles of Creditization of all Learning — Formal, Non-Formal,
Informal and Recognition of Prior Learning:
i. Defining Learning Outcomes (LOs)
ii | Mapping with Qualification/ NOS/ Course/ MC
iii, | Assign Appropriate NCrF Levels based on Level Descriptors & Credits
iv. Defining Assessment Criteria & Methodology
v. Conducting Learning & Assessment as per Criteria
vi. Award of Credits & Deposit in Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
° NCiF provides for creditization of all types of learning irrespective the type, level,
delivery mode, of learning, including Informal & Non-Formal Learning.
° No differentiation in Credits assigned for different areas of learning: arts and
sciences, curricular and extra-curricular activities, vocational and academic
streams
° NCIF also enables creditization of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). The RPL
refers to an assessment process used to evaluate a person's existing skill sets,
knowledge, competency and experience gained either by formal, non-formal or
informal learning.
The other Key Aspects of the Creditization Process
1. Standardized Levels and Criteria: The frameworks provide standardized levels and
criteria for assigning credits. The credits should be awarded based on the assessment of
learning outcomes rather than the duration or type of learning. This ensures that the credits
reflect the actual knowledge, skills, and competencies acquired by the learner.
2. Transparent and Consistent Policies: Institutions should establish clear policies for
creditization, defining the criteria for awarding credits, the assessment methods used, and
the maximum credits that can be earned through different types of learning.
3. Flexibility: The creditization process should be flexible to accommodate the diverse needs
of learners. This includes recognizing prior learning (RPL) and providing opportunities for
learners to demonstrate their competencies through various assessment methods.
--- Page 47 ---
4. Autonomy for Institutions: While adhering to national frameworks and standards,
institutions have the autonomy to develop and implement their creditization policies. This
allows them to tailor the process to their specific programs and student populations.
The Overview of the creditization process as per NCrF is given in the figure 5 below:
Figure 5: Overview of the creditization process as per NCrF.
7.6.2 Creditization and Credit Management under NCrF
Creditization and credit management as per NCrF guidance will form an important reference for
earning and management of credit under RPL. The end-to-end assignment of credits and its

10.1
Governance Process
The delineation of authority and responsibilities for making and verifying decisions regarding
the recognition of prior learning should be explicitly defined. The major stakeholders involved
in the implementation and governance of RPL in Higher Education are as follows:
Assessment Centres/Bodies (ACB)
Responsibilities: Establish policies, procedures, and criteria for assessing prior
learning; oversee the assessment process; and award academic credit or qualifications
based on prior learning.
Authority: Decide whether to centralize or decentralize the arrangements for
assessing prior learning across departments, schools, or faculties. Clarify the locus of
authority and responsibilities for decision-making and verification with partner
organizations.
Academic Staff and Subject Experts
Responsibilities: Design assessment methods, evaluate evidence, and make
decisions regarding the recognition of prior learning within their respective fields or
disciplines.
Competence: Ensure all involved parties possess the requisite competence, have
adequate time, and resources allocated for their tasks.
Staff Awareness and Involvement
Responsibilities: Ensure academic staff, including those from partner organizations
and external examiners, are well-informed about the ACB’s approach to accrediting
prior learning. Staff should be aware of situations where they may play a role in the
recognition process.
Assessor
Responsibilities: Evaluate the evidence provided by learners and make judgments
about the extent to which it meets the required standards or criteria.
Qualifications: Possess the requisite qualifications as per the National Higher
Education Framework (NHEQF) or National Skills Qualifications Framework
(NSQF).
Recognition Advisory Committee
Responsibilities: Advise on the development, implementation, and review of RPL
accreditation policies and procedures.
Composition: Representatives from academic, administrative, and industry
stakeholders.
--- Page 55 ---
vi. Assessment and Recognition Committees
° Responsibilities: Review evidence submitted by learners and make decisions
regarding the recognition of their prior learning.
° Composition: Academic staff and administrators.
vii. Recognition Appeals Committee
° Responsibilities: Inform learners about the outcomes of their recognition appeals,
including the committee's decision, rationale, and any follow-up actions or
recommendations.
viii. | Quality Assurance Bodies
° Responsibilities: Monitor and evaluate the RPL process to ensure fairness,
consistency, and adherence to established standards.
° Entities: External quality assurance agencies or internal quality assurance teams
within HEIs.
ix. Professional, Statutory, and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs)
° Responsibilities: Set standards or requirements for the recognition of prior learning,
especially when it pertains to professional qualifications or licensure.
xX. Learners
° Responsibilities: Actively participate by providing evidence, engaging in assessment
activities, and adhering to relevant policies and procedures.
xi. Employers and Industry Partners
° Responsibilities: Validate the relevance and currency of prior learning in
professional contexts, when applicable.
By clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, the RPL process can be
effectively managed, ensuring that prior learning is recognized accurately and equitably.
10.1.1 Training of Academic Staff and other Stakeholders
Higher Educational Institutions, Awarding Bodies and ACBs must guarantee that all staff,
including those from partner organisations and external examiners, engaged in the RPL process,
receive comprehensive information, adequate training, and ongoing support to fulfil their roles
effectively. The roles of individuals providing guidance and support to applicants in preparing
evidence for their claims, as well as those responsible for assessing claims, should be clearly
defined and appropriate training should be provided in advance.
An individual or designated academic staff member will be responsible for coordinating and
overseeing the RPL accreditation process within an educational institution or organization.
10.2 Monitoring and Review Process
Continuous review and improvement in the RPL framework based on feedback from
stakeholders, emerging trends in the labour market, and advancements in educational practices
is very crucial to the success of RPL. Additionally, Technology should be used to the extent
possible, to create fair assessment processes including evidence of assessment. This will ensure
that the RPL process remains relevant, fair, and effective in supporting the educational
aspirations of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences. While Higher Educational
Institutions would be encouraged to set up Committees at the College and University level, it is
recommended as follows:
--- Page 56 ---
e Steering Committee at the UGC Level which will be the Apex body to monitor and
review the program from time to time.
e RPL Program monitoring committee at the UGC recognized centres/bodies and at the
Assessment bodies to monitor the progress and of the RPL program from time to
time.
e RPL program review committee at the UGC recognised RPL centres to review the
RPL program from time to time.
e RPL appellate committee to address appeals received from candidate and to decide
and dispose the matters related appeal decisions received from the Ombudsman at the
assessment bodies and centres.
e The steering committee at the UGC level may also act as final appeal authority for
any unresolved appeals/issues.
10.3. Appeal mechanism
The UGC recognized centres and assessment bodies should develop a formal process of
addressing and resolving appeals submitted by learners regarding assessment decisions or
outcomes related to their RPL accreditation application, ensuring transparency, fairness, and
adherence to policies and procedures. A predefined timeline or schedule outlining the stages and
duration of the recognition appeals process, including deadlines for submitting appeals,
reviewing submissions, and communicating outcomes shall be developed and notified by the
centres and bodies. The flow chart related to appeal mechanism is illustrated in Figure 8.
Submission of Appeal Application
Scrutiny by the Appeal Committee
Appointment of an independent external Assessor
Submission of Assessor report to the Appeal Committee for asuitable decision
(5)\Communicating the final decision to the Learner
Figure 8. A flow chart illustrating the steps for appeal mechanism.
Once a final decision is communicated to the learner, no further appeal will be entertained. A
realistic timeline will be notified by the Awarding bodies/HEIs to dispose of the appeal
applications. The decision taken by the appeal committee will be binding on the learner.
Information about the appeal mechanism will be provided at the commencement of the RPL
procedure. If the applicant wishes to appeal the assessment decision, the learner shall have to
follow the learner appeal procedure as mentioned above.
The RPL centres of HEI should also keep digital records of assessment process, which can be
used as support evidence for the appeal resolution.
--- Page 57 ---
11. Enhancing Internationalisation and Mobility with RPL
Internationalization and mobility are crucial for candidates who earn credits or qualifications
through RPL from Indian assessment bodies. These factors enhance opportunities for further
education and professional development of student/ learner globally.
° Internationalization refers to enabling RPL to validate learning in the international
contexts which is recognised by some of the other countries.
° Mobility refers to the ability to transfer and utilize RPL credits seamlessly across
different international, national, geographic, educational, and professional
environments.
In a globalized world, where people frequently move across regions or countries for education
or employment, these aspects are vital. The following suggestions aim to enhance
internationalization and mobility in the context of RPL. Detailed recommendations are provided
