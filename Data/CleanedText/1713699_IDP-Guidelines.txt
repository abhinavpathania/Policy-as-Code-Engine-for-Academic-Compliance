Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
Preface
In the tapestry of India's educational landscape, Higher Education
Institutions (HEIs) play a pivotal role, extending beyond academia to shape
the country's future through knowledge, research, and innovation. These
institutions are instrumental in building the nation, fostering socio-
economic empowerment, and ensuring global competitiveness.
The "UGC Guidelines for the Institutional Development Plan for Higher Educational Institutions
(HEls)" serves as a guiding light for institutions striving to evolve and excel within this dynamic
educational framework. This comprehensive framework is a culmination of insights, best
practices, and collective wisdom gleaned from esteemed leaders, policymakers, and
educational visionaries across India.
Acknowledging the diverse challenges and immense opportunities within India's higher
education sector, these guidelines present a strategic roadmap tailored to empower HEls.
Whether it's elevating academic standards, fostering research excellence, championing
inclusivity, or embracing technological advancements, this resource aims to equip institutions
with the requisite tools to navigate the evolving landscape effectively.
Emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, industry alliances, and community engagement,
these guidelines advocate for a holistic approach to institutional growth. They aspire to
cultivate an environment where innovation flourishes, knowledge is accessible to all, and a
pursuit of excellence becomes intrinsic to the ethos of every HEI.
Recognizing the distinctiveness of each institution, shaped by its context, strengths, and
aspirations, these guidelines are designed to be adaptable. They encourage HEls to tailor their
development strategies while upholding fundamental principles of academic integrity, fairness,
and responsibility.
As India's higher education sector charts its course to greater prominence globally, these
guidelines aim to ignite transformative growth within institutions. May they inspire a new era
of HEls that not only meet the evolving needs of the nation but also contribute significantly to
the global academic narrative.
Warm regards,
Prof. M Jagadesh Kumar
Chairman

Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
PREAMBLE:
World over there is an increasing interest in the quality and standards of education and higher
education, reflecting both its rapid growth and cost to the public and the private finances. Our
imperative of nation building, an equitable and just society, and doing justice to the current
and future generations of Indians is predicated on achieving our aspiration to be the leading
knowledge-based economy in the world. Indian higher education will need to demonstrate
that it takes quality to a significantly more advanced level and puts into place the means of
attaining, demonstrating and assuring that sustainable quality.
The Hon’ble Prime Minister has observed that the large number of upcoming universities,
colleges, IITs, IIMs and AIIMS are the strong building blocks of new India. India’s rich education
system is the carrier of India's prosperity. Soft power of India is becoming a success story of
the Indian youth. Our new generation should be future-ready, with the temperament to
accept and face challenges, this is possible only through the vision and mission of high-quality
educational institutions.
The challenges and demands, which are emerging both inside and outside India in the face of
this context and the internationalization of higher education, demand a powerful and
concerted response. The commitment of all those involved in the creation, discovery,
dissemination, connecting and application of knowledge, augurs well for the fulfilment of a
truly Indian approach to the quality and quality assurance of our higher education ecosystems.
Enabling the Higher Educational Institutions (HEI) to undertake the Academic and Professional
Excellence journey is at the heart of these guidelines. The vision of, the National Education
Policy (NEP) 2020, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), National Credit Framework (NCrF),
and Integration with the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) among other anchors, lie at the core
in the pursuit of higher level goals. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, seeks to
transform higher education by focusing on skill-based education to meet the needs of the
industry and the economy.
The National Education Policy 2020 enunciates that Quality Higher Education needs to aim to
develop good, thoughtful, well-rounded, and creative individuals. HEls need to enable an
individual to study one or more specialized areas of interest at a deep level and also develop
character, ethical and constitutional values, intellectual curiosity, scientific temper, creativity,
spirit of service, and 21st-century capabilities across a range of disciplines including sciences,
social sciences, arts, humanities, languages, as well as professional, technical, and vocational
subjects.
The UGC has sought to provide guidelines for individual HEls to develop their own Institutional
Development Plans to further these aims set out in the NEP 2020.

Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
Social and Academic Mission
The social mission is the main purpose of being for an HEI or a program in terms of doing
social good. In the context of the IDP, this will enable the HEIs to not only become self-reliant
centres of excellence for their academic and professional growth and research and
developmental outcomes but also contribute to the overall social good by a multitude of other
aspects such as:
i. Equitable access to high quality affordable higher education for all including te Persons
with Disability (PwD).
ii. | Knowledge creation for societal growth and well-being through cutting-edge research,
technical and non-technical solutions to societal problems conceptualised by HEls.
iii. Integration & embedding of vocational education, training & skilling into higher
education; Creditisation of all learning and integrating credits from academic, vet &
skilling and experiential learning
iv. Creation of industry fit and entrepreneurial human resources for improving quality of
life, the standard of living, all-round development, wellbeing and social good.
v. Reducing inequalities and enhancing gender parity, ensuring diversity and inclusivity
and environmental awareness towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and
other such overall goals.
vi. Internationalization of higher education, skilling and mobility of students, learners and
workforce at all levels etc.
The academic mission in the context of IDP needs to be the portfolio of robust aims of the
institution which seek to help students develop an understanding and appreciation for the
complex cultural and physical worlds in which they live and to realize their highest potential
of intellectual, physical and human development. The Mission can further be summarised as
below:
i. Promoting and strengthening holistic education, multi-disciplinarity, cross-
disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity in the mutually supporting interdependent
learning driven world.
ii. The facilitation and enablement of achieving key learning outcomes from the core
learning of a discipline and its prescribed curriculum.
iii. | Development of character, ethical and Constitutional values, intellectual curiosity,
scientific temper, creativity, spirit of service, and contemporary capabilities across a
range of disciplines including sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, languages, as
well as professional, technical, and vocational subjects.
iv. Learning to think, understand and do through skills and competencies such as critical
thinking and problem solving, creative thinking and innovation, analytical thinking,
adaptive thinking, design thinking & creativity, computational thinking, social
intelligence, cross cultural competency, new media literacy, virtual collaboration,

decision making, conflict resolution and negotiations among many others. Thus
building the foundations of a proclivity for continuous and lifelong learning.
Basic Principles
Emergent India with its multiple states is characterised by its diversity of socio-cultural
traditions, languages, and nuanced in aspirations and expectations. This is currently
accompanied by a range of institutions including - Universities, Deemed-to-be Universities,
Colleges, Professional, Specialised, and Vocational/ Skilling etc. While the NEP 2020 and its
forward-looking concomitants like National Credit Framework (NCrF) provide an overarching
policy framework, this makes a single monolithic approach to quality, standards and quality
assurance in higher education inappropriate.
In the light of India’s diversity and variety, generally acknowledged as a strength, the
Guidelines avoid a narrow, prescriptive and a rigidly formulated approach. There is a
preference to generic principles, while being mindful of the specific requirements. One
consequence of the generic principle is that the Guidelines focus on a balance of what should
be the vision and action plan and how this can be best achieved and realised.
In sum, it is important to emphasize that these Guidelines are intended to enable various
stages of this journey towards excellence in Higher Education with a concomitant ethos of
continuous improvement, refinement, feedback and review based on our collective
experience of their pursuit in the years to come.
It is equally important to emphasise that these Guidelines are framed to enable HEls within
the statutory, regulatory and mandated requirements of acts, rules, regulations, codes and
guidelines as promulgated and applicable by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and
other appropriate regulatory authorities like All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE),
National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), National Council for Teachers’
Education (NCTE), from time to time.
These Guidelines for HEls are founded on key principles and approaches that emphasize:
i. Supporting HEls in academic, research, and teaching excellence.
ii. Promoting learner-centric teaching, knowledge creation, innovation, and
knowledge application.
iii. Advocating a multi-disciplinary integration including science, arts, humanities,
vocational, sports, and more.
iv. Enabling integration and embedding of vocational education, training & skilling
and the general education holistic learning as per National Education Policy 2020
and National Credit Framework (NCrF).
v. Enabling HEls to balance comprehensive academic, administrative and financial
autonomy with accountability, alongside with responsibility and IDP framework
flexibility.

Main Objectives and Goals to be Achieved by IDP:
The IDP needs to reflect an integrated, comprehensive and holistic approach that is mindful
of every institution’s unique vision/mission, context, life cycle stage, location, character,
resources, environment, target group of students/ learners, other stakeholders and overall
aspirations. The overarching purpose and aims of each unique institution are the key
determinants of the mix of choices that will create excellence for that particular institution.
The main objectives of the IDP are :-

Strategic Goals and Development Objectives
Strategy Formulation
Strategic Formulation needs institutional leadership with a coherence of direction and
sustained efforts over time. Hence tenure, quality of leadership and direction are key factors
at the very heart of a good strategy. Equally important is the flow from strategic goals (as
directional) into tangible (measurable milestone) objectives. The strategic (directional) goals
are indicative of the compass to guide the journey and Institutional Development goals are
sought to be indicated as the chosen pathways of institutional pursuit of those directional
aspirations.
The following are Indicative basic steps for all HEls in this journey: —
i. Identify Strategic Goals: Define the purpose, vision, and goals of the academic
institution, including what the institution wants to achieve and why through the use
of tools and techniques for strategy formulation like -
a. Conduct a SWOC Analysis: Assess the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
and Challenges (SWOC) of the institution to determine opportunities and
choices that need to be leveraged and areas that need improvement.
b. Utilize appropriate models like the “S-Curve Analysis”, “Portfolio Analysis” etc:
Plot the institution's progress using S-Curve Analysis to visualize its growth
trajectory and identify potential bottlenecks. This will determine if the “Path is
clear for scale and impact” especially for younger institutions. Determine a
Portfolio Mix for the institution of choices of “streams of capability”,
programmes, products and offerings.
c. Determine the sustainability and viability proposition for all stakeholders over
time as an anchor / beacon. Undertake Stakeholder analysis to underpin the
rationale for the Choice of Strategic goals.
d. Analyze and align Interlinkages: Examine the interlinkages between different
areas of the institution, such as “streams of capability”, academic programs,
pedagogy, research initiatives, field/ community/ industry engagement, and
student and faculty support services, to ensure alignment with overall goals.
ii. Define Objectives: Break down the goals into specific, measurable, attainable,
relevant, and time-bound objectives.
iii. Identify Tactics: Determine the most effective choice of ways to achieve the objectives,
including the allocation of resources, partnerships, thrust areas, initiatives and
sequencing. The enabling processes and incentivisation ( material and intangible
modes) of garnering funding, support and energy for success.
iv. _ Prioritize Initiatives: Determine which initiatives are most important, their sequencing
and allocate resources accordingly. Identify and garner / mobilise resources.

Develop the Plan: Outline a detailed plan of action, including timelines, milestones,
and responsible parties for each initiative.
Implement the Plan: Execute the plan and monitor progress, making adjustments as
needed.
Review, Evaluate and Report: Regularly review and evaluate the plan, including
measuring progress against objectives, using the S-Curve and analysing interlinkages,
and making changes as needed to ensure continued success.
A. Strategic Goals
These are indicative only. Institutions need to set their strategic goals in their own
words. These goals serve as a guide. Institutions can customize them based on their
specific context.
Ensure accessible, affordable, and transparent student admissions, emphasizing
equality.
Streamline recruitment, training, motivation, and retention of skilled faculty.
Prioritize a student-focused approach, enhancing faculty skills for better
educational outcomes.

Seamlessly integrate quality skill education within higher education.
Enhance student employability on both national and international fronts.
Develop a sustainable research and innovation environment.
Foster relationships with alumni, communities, industries, and other stakeholders
for institutional growth.
Strengthen Academia-Industry and Academia-Community partnerships via diverse
initiatives.
Adopt the National Credit Framework (NCrF) and Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
for a fluid student mobility and flexible learning. Establish a rigorous accreditation
system emphasizing transparency, autonomy, and quality outcomes.
Development Objectives
These are indicative only. These objectives may be categorised as illustrated below and
conceived of as discrete but integrated dimensions of the institutions development.
Academic and Fiduciary Governance: This category includes objectives related to
the management of the institution, and oversight of the institution's academic
programs and processes.
Curriculum and Pedagogy: This category includes objectives related to the design
and delivery of academic programs, such as curriculum excellence and pedagogical
excellence.
Integration of Skills into Academics at all levels: This category includes objectives
related to integration of vocational education/ skills into general education as
required under holistic education as envisaged by NEP 2020/ National Credit
Framework (NCrF) through National Higher Education Qualification Framework
(NHEQF) aligned courses or National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) aligned
courses and Qualifications.
Faculty and Staff: This category includes objectives related to the recruitment,
development, retention, and promotion of faculty and staff. Human Resource
Management (HRM) is pivotal for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Given the
unique blend of academia, research, and administration within HEls, effective HRM
ensures that the right talent is attracted, nurtured, and retained. By fostering a
conducive environment for academic and research excellence, HRM shapes the
institution's ethos, culture, drives innovation, and influences educational
outcomes. Furthermore, through strategic planning, training, and development,
HRM plays an indispensable role in ensuring HEls stay at the forefront of global
education trends and standards.
Governance and Compliance: This category includes objectives related to the
institution's administrative, and financial governance, as well as its compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements
Page 13 of 63
--- Page 14 ---
vi.
vi.
vii.
Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
Research and Development. This category includes objectives related to the
institution's overall research and innovation goals. For effective Research and
Development, institutions need to establish a clear strategy encompassing:
defining research goals, and a research portfolio, aligned with institutional aims,
securing external funding, provisioning essential research infrastructure, recruiting
and mentoring top-tier research faculty, and fostering collaborations and
partnerships. Additionally, they should uphold research integrity through
established ethical practices, amplify research findings across academic and public
platforms, enable implementation of actionable points, and where possible
monetization of research (including start-up support and intellectual property
management), conduct thorough research assessments, and instate efficient
research management systems.
Cc. Operationalisation
Recognising that Institutional Development is being undertaken by the HEls, it is
imperative that the autonomy of the institutes is maintained while developing and
operationalising the Plan for such an endeavour. Therefore, the IDP guidelines are self-
regulating in nature. The HEIs may choose to provide institutional support and infuse
collaboration and coherence across various units, departments and activities in
operationalisation with appropriate mechanisms to effectively implement the IDP.
The key enablers to this are:
Clear Objectives: Begin with well-defined, measurable objectives that align with
the institution's mission.
Task Breakdown: Decompose each strategic goal into specific, actionable tasks or
initiatives.
Overall Stewardship & Responsibility Allocation: Provision for governance
oversight and assign specific tasks to a particular department, team, or individual,
ensuring collaboration & interlinkage with clarity in roles and expectations.
Collaborative Environment: Promote a culture of collaboration and knowledge
sharing, allowing for synergies between departments and teams
Metrics & KPIs: Establish clear metrics and Key Performance Indicators to evaluate
progress and effectiveness of individual tasks and interlinked outcomes.
Technological Tools: Implement management and monitoring software to
automate tracking, reporting, and communication.
Communication Channels: Maintain transparent and open lines of
communication among all stakeholders to ensure alignment and foster a sense of
ownership.
Page 14 of 63
--- Page 15 ---
Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
viii. Training & Development: Offer continuous training and professional development
to equip staff with the necessary skills and knowledge.
ix. Resource Allocation: Ensure sufficient resources (financial, technological, human)
are dedicated to each strategic initiative.
x. Feedback Mechanisms: Implement regular reviews, surveys, and feedback loops
to gauge progress and make necessary adjustments..
xi. Agility: Develop an adaptive mindset, timely decision making allowing for
flexibility in the face of changing external factors or unforeseen challenges.
xii. Stakeholder Engagement: Involve all relevant stakeholders, from faculty and staff
to students and external partners, ensuring a holistic approach.
xiii. Continuous Review: Periodically revisit the strategy to ensure its relevance and
make adjustments based on evolving institutional needs and external shifts.
By prioritizing and integrating these enablers, HEls can effectively operationalize their
strategic goals and drive towards successful implementation.

Institute Development Plan (IDP) FRAMEWORK - Major
Components (Parameters for Institutional Excellence)
As stated above, The IDP needs to reflect an integrated approach that is mindful of the
institution’s context, life cycle stage, location, character, and aspirations. While each
parameter represents a vertical and has depth, the need to integrate these into an optimal
whole cannot be overemphasised. The overarching purpose along with the aims of each
unique institution are the key determinants of the mix of choices that will create excellence
for the institution. The 9 Enabler Parameters are enumerated here (and elaborated in the
Annexure section). While significantly interconnected and interdependent, they are
articulated in a logical flow emerging from the Strategic choices of the HEI and their
manifestation into the parameters of Enablers of Governance, Financial, to Academic,
Research & Intellectual Property, Networking & Collaboration, Human Resources, Supportive
& Facilitative, Physical and Digital. The sequence of approaching these has benefits to the
planning process and subsequent iterations. It is imperative for the Institutions to configure
the Physical, Digital enablers as foundational, albeit “purpose driven” elements of the IDP.
While each of these are substantive and have “stand alone” depth, they provide the web of
parameters for thinking through the plan, warranting an iterative, continuous and concurrent
approach to the journey towards Excellence.
A. Governance Enablers
1. Overview:
In the context of HEls, governance refers to the systematic approach by which
educational institutions are directed, controlled, and held accountable. It
encompasses the methods and frameworks utilized for decision-making, risk
monitoring, and performance enhancement.
a) While it is process-oriented, good governance is integral to establishing an
institution's core values and culture. Governance needs to balance and integrate
the “belief systems” and the “control systems”.
b) Governance within HEIs not only revolves around institutional structures and
policy development but also entails a comprehensive mesh of legislative &
regulatory frameworks, financial accountabilities, as well as informal structures
that guide institutional behaviour.
c) Good governance in HEls seeks to strike a balance between institutional autonomy
and accountability. It can be a self-driven initiative by HEls to demonstrate
responsible autonomy, an alignment with modern public management strategies,
or a protective measure against potential mismanagement.

8)
Institutional Structures: Establishing active leadership bodies like the Board of
Governors (BOG), Senate, or Syndicate, Academic Councils, Finance
Committees, and other prescribed and required bodies that ensure decision-
making coherence and clarity.
Balanced Autonomy: Offering autonomy to HEls should be complemented by
transparent accountability mechanisms, promoting responsible — self-
management.
Quality Assurance: Robust processes and quality control mechanisms are vital
to maintain and elevate academic standards.
Stakeholder Inclusion: Encouraging comprehensive stakeholder involvement,
especially from alumni, enriches decision-making by integrating diverse
perspectives.
Financial Independence: Setting levels of financial autonomy aids in steering
the institution towards self-sustainability.
Alignment with Society: Effective governance aligns academic values with
societal expectations, ensuring institutions remain relevant and responsive.
Leadership and Strategy: Emphasizing leadership skills, combined with a clear
strategic vision, equip institutions to tackle present challenges and future
uncertainties.

2. How to improve Governance:
Ensuring fully functional BOG/ Senate/ Syndicate/ Academic Council
a) Providing autonomy with full accountability wrt all aspects of governance in
HEI
b) Putting in place processes and quality assurance mechanisms
c) Involving all stakeholder including alumni in the processes leading to
appointments/nominations/selections in the | BoG/Senate/Syndicate/
Academic Council
d) Various levels of financial autonomy to be defined including striving for self-
sustainability
e) Focusing on good governance which strives to preserve the integrity of the
academic value system while at the same time adequacy of control systems.
B. Financial Enablers and Funding Models (Resource Generation)
1. Overview
Financial Enablers are the heart of the financial system and a prerequisite for its
operation. Financial Enablers comprise the technical systems that deal with payments
and financial instruments. A robust financial Enablers system would help the
institutions to make and receive payments safely and efficiently along with creating
routes for sustained research funding options.
A crucial enabler for HEls would also be the inculcation of a professional and
contemporary Financial Management approach within the compliance, regulatory and
statutory boundaries. While Compliant Accounting is a non-negotiable requirement,
Management accounting and data-based decision support can hugely strengthen the
HEls ability to navigate issues and options for financial structuring and resource
mobilisation.
2. How to improve Financial Enablers:
a) Funding Sources: Identify and prioritize the existing & additional sources of
funding for the development of financial enablers such as government grants,
project overheads, research consultancies, patents, alumni donations, private
sector partnerships, and fundraising campaigns.
b) The public funded as well as other HEls must strive to work on a sustainable
revenue model where the revenues are derived from the following main sources
such as:
i. tuition fee from the students
ii. | government grants and subsidies
Page 18 of 63
--- Page 19 ---
Institutional Development Plans for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)
overheads earned on the sponsored research and development projects
from the Government and private/ corporate sector
endowments, philanthropic contributions and other income like CSR,
royalties on intellectual property (IP)/ patents etc.
c) In a fully developed HEI, each of these sources need to contribute a balanced
percentage to the total revenue, depending on the strategy & size of the HEls.
Therefore, HEls must also focus on expanding their revenue sources in a “fit for
strategy” model.
