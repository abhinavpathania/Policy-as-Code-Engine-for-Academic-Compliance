FOREWORD
The aim of higher Education in India is to provide access, equity, quality with accountability at
affordable cost to all aspiring Citizens with utmost transparency to ensure sustainable economic
development of the nation. It is achieved through creation, dissemination and application of
knowledge. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has been in existence since
November 1945 as a national Level Apex Advisory Body and as a statutory body through an Act
of Parliament in 1987 with its mission of developing and promoting quality Technical Education
in the Country in a coordinated and integrated manner. The Council’s constant endeavour is to
encourage a meaningful association between the Technical Education system and research and
development activities in a concerted effort aimed at nation building.
The third major revamp of the framework of education in India since independence cleared by
the Cabinet in the form of new National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 on 29th July 2020 with an
aim to introduce several changes in the Indian education system from the school to college level.
The major revamp in Higher Education includes:
India to be a Global Knowledge Superpower
Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)
Multiple Exit and Entry in Higher Education
Academic Bank of Credits to facilitate Transfer of Credit
The National Research Foundation for funding Research.
A single umbrella body for the entire higher education, Higher Education Commission of
India (HECI) excluding medical and legal education. HECI to have four councils viz.,
National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC) for regulation,
General Education Council (GEC) for standard setting,
Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC) for funding,
National Accreditation Council (NAC) for accreditation.
National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) for use of technology in education
National Educational Qualification Framework (NEQF).
The National Education Policy aims to facilitate an inclusive, participatory and holistic approach,
which takes into consideration field experiences, empirical research, stakeholder feedback, as
well as lessons learned from best practices. It is a progressive shift towards a more scientific
approach to education. The prescribed structure will help to cater the ability of the child - stages
of cognitive development as well as social and physical awareness. If implemented in its true
vision, the new structure can bring India at par with the leading countries of the world.
The Cabinet has also approved the renaming of the Ministry of Human Resource Development to
the Ministry of Education. Henceforth, The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is now
as a statutory body of Ministry of Education, Govt. of India.
Technical Education at all Levels is witnessing a severe competition and only those Institutions
who strive for excellence will survive. The Council believes in providing all kinds of support
All India Council for Technical Education
--- Page 5 ---
and encourage Institutions to think beyond the Curriculum while imparting training for the
advancement of knowledge. The Council has put in place several initiatives to bring about
changes in the Approval Process by introducing greater transparency and accountability through
the e-governance. AICTE has been constantly endeavouring to simplify the procedures and
bringing greater ease in the approval process through informal and formal interactions with
all stakeholders. The role of AICTE, as a true facilitator of quality Technical Education is evident
from the changes made in the Approval Process Handbook along with the revised Gazette Policy,
Regulation No. F.No: AB /AICTE /REG /2020 of AICTE dated 4** February, 2020 and amended
as per F.No: AB /AICTE /REG /2020 (1% Amendment, 2021) of AICTE dated 24" February, 2021.
This is expected to create an academic ambience in the Technical Institutions for nurturing and
supporting quality, so that Technical Education in India will be one of the best in the world.
Supporting Institutions for Autonomy, Accreditation of Programmes, Ranking ofinstitutions,
schemes such as Margdarshan, Adjunct Faculty, Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, Research Promotion
Scheme(RPS), AICTE Doctoral Fellowship (ADF), Short Term Training Programme (STTP), National
Initiative for Technical Teachers Training (NITTT), AICTE - IDEALAB, a MOOCs platform SWAYAM,
Smart India Hackathons, Start-up Policy 2016 and modified in 2019, Scheme for supporting
clubs in institutes (SPICES), are a few of the important initiatives embarked upon by AICTE.Model
Curricula Teacher Training Programmes for both new teachers and in service teachers through
ATAL academies, Student Induction Programme, mandatory Internship for Students, Examination
Reforms, support for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Industry Interaction Cells, National
Perspective Plan for Technical Education are some of the works undertaken. AICTE has signed
several MoUs with both Government Departments and private Organizations, NGOs, Start-ups
for supporting students and Institutions in getting internship opportunities. The Introduction of
National Academic Depository for storing all students’ Educational Certificates, all Fee collections
and scholarship disbursals through cashless digital means are major changes initiated by the
Government of India and implemented by AICTE.
This handbook is an attempt to provide comprehensive information on the fair and rational
system of administration as well as other necessary information on the processes involved under
the aegis of AICTE. The emphasis on e-governance to ensure transparency and accountability,
and implementing a tech-savvy approach to enable faster processing and clearly defining the
Infrastructural norms in Institutions are just a few pointers towards AICTE’s efforts at fostering a
Technical Education system which is on par with the best Institutions in the world.
Swami Vivekananda said “Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man”. In
keeping with this objective, apart from regulatory role, AICTE shall continue to strive to be a
true mentor, facilitator and enabler in bringing out the best in each Institution. We hope all the
stakeholders of Technical Education shall also put in their best and make team India proud and
make “Atmanirbhar Bharat” a reality.

PREAMBLE
Background and Statutory Provision under AICTE Act Regarding Planning, Promotion and
Regulation of Technical Education
The beginning of formal Technical Education in India can be dated back to the mid-19th Century. The major
Policy initiatives in the pre-independence period included the appointment of the Indian Universities
Commission in 1902, issue of the Indian Education Policy resolution in 1904 and the Governor General’s
Policy statement of 1913 stressing the importance of Technical Education, the establishment of IISc in
Bangalore, Institute for Sugar, Textile and Leather Technology in Kanpur, National Council of Education in
Bengal and Industrial Schools in several provinces. Significant developments include:
i. Constitution of the Technical Education Committee of the Central Advisory Board of Education
(CABE) of 1943;
ii. Preparation of the Sergeant Report of 1944; and
iii. Formation of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1945 by the Government of
India.
AICTE was set up in November 1945 based on the recommendations of CABE to stimulate, coordinate and
control the provisions of Educational facilities and industrial development of the post war period. At that
time, a mandate of AICTE covered only Programmes in Engineering and Technology.
The growth of industries in the Country, just after independence, also demanded the need for qualified
professionals in other fields, such as Business Management, Architecture, Hotel Management, Pharmacy
etc. Although the diverse elements of Management such as Commerce, Economics, Finance, Psychology
and Industrial Sociology were being taught for a long time, the need for Management Education in a
formal way was felt in India only in the fifties. The Government of India decided in 1954 to set up a Board
of Management Studies under AICTE to formulate standards and promote Management Education. Other
major initiatives taken in Management Education include setting up of the Administrative Staff College of
India at Hyderabad in the late fifties, National Productivity Council and Indian Institute of Management
in the early sixties. Architecture was covered under the Architects Act, 1972. Subsequently, for better
coordination of the Professional Courses, Architecture Education was also placed under the purview of
AICTE.
Hotel Management Education had a modest beginning with short Programmes in Nutrition and Food
Science, which started in the late fifties. The National Council of Hotel Management and Catering
Technology were set up in 1982, to which all the Institutions of Hotel Management run by the Government
are affiliated.
Education in other professional fields such as, Pharmacy, Applied Arts, Crafts and Design has also undergone
similar developments during the post-independence period. Programmes for Technical Education, during
the first three Five Year Plans, were devoted to the expansion of Technical Education to meet the growing
demand for technical personnel at Diploma, Degree and Post Graduate Levels. From the fourth Five Year Plan
onwards, the emphasis was shifted to the improvement of quality and standards of Technical Education.
This was done through implementation of the Quality Improvement Programme consisting of three major
components that provided for M.E. /M. Tech. and Ph.D. Programmes, Establishment of Curriculum Design
and Development Cells, and Short Term Training Programmes.
Meanwhile, expansion of Institutions and Intake remained at a low Level in the Government, Private-aided
and University sectors. The Policy Shift during the eighties towards involvement of Private and Voluntary
Organizations in the setting up of the Technical and Management Institutions on self-financing basis
ushered in an era of unprecedented expansion of the Technical Education System, a trend which has
continued during successive Five-year Plans.
It was in this context that AICTE was given statutory powers by AICTE Act of Parliament in 1987, with a view
to ensure the proper planning and coordinated development of the Technical Education System throughout

. Current Status of Technical Education
The growth of Technical Education in the Country before independence was very slow. The number of
Engineering Colleges and Polytechnics in 1947 was 44 and 43 with an Intake capacity of 3200 and 3400
respectively.
Due to the efforts and initiatives taken during successive Five-year Plans and particularly due to Policy
changes in the eighties to allow participation of Private and Voluntary Organizations in the setting up of
Technical Institutions on self-financing basis, the growth of Technical Education has been phenomenal.
Technical Education at all Levels in the Country is witnessing a consistent growth pattern marked by the
setting up of new Technical Institutions and the improvement of the existing ones in tune with the quality
assurance norms set by the regulating and accreditation agencies.

organizes all qualifications according to a series of Levels of knowledge, skills and aptitude.
These Levels, graded from one to ten, are defined in terms of learning outcomes which the
learners must possess regardless of whether they are obtained through formal, Non-Formal or
informal learning.
Vocational Courses may be affiliated with existing University or any Skill University/ National
University having jurisdiction for affiliation/ Board of Technical Education as the case may be.

ANNEXURE 1
Recommended Short and Medium Term Perspectives for Engineering
Education in India by the Committee to Provide National Perspective
Plan
Technology and Globalization have turned Countries into knowledge-driven economies. They are radically
accelerating the pace of change in the world and raising the long-term risks. Success in knowledge-driven and
innovation-driven world order depends largely on the capabilities ofthe people, and higher education, especially
Engineering education, is the key to building those requisite capabilities. India has done phenomenally well in
creating large infrastructure across the Country to disseminate Engineering education to lakhs of aspirants in
every State year after year. However, to be able to cater to the next-generation of Engineering skill requirements,
we need to facilitate quality and accredited Technical Education at scale. In our efforts to support the reforms in
Engineering education, we have studied the current state of Engineering education and present, in this report,
our short and medium term perspectives and recommendations.
Recommendations:
1. Current (2017-18) capacity utilization in Under Graduate and Post Graduate Level is as low as 49.8%
(Capacity Vs Enrolment). Creating any further capacity is a big drain on investments since, at the very
basic Level, it involves the creation of physical infrastructure like Buildings and Laboratory infrastructure.
We recommend that we do not create any new capacity starting from the Academic Year 2020. The
creation of new capacity can be reviewed every two years after that.
2. While we take such a serious decision, we also recognize that there could be some applications in the
pipeline for additional/ new capacity applied in the last one or two years. These may be pending for
want of some minor clearances. So, applications made in the current year and the past two years may be
considered for starting Institutions, if the infrastructure is already in place.
3. We recommend that AICTE should take capacity utilization as a key consideration while granting
additional capacities in different States.
4. Traditional Engineering disciplines such as Mechanical, Electrical, Civil and Electronics Engineering
capacity utilization around 40% as opposed to Computer Science and Engineering, Aerospace
Engineering, Mechatronics, being in the high 60%. This is clear pointer that the demand lies in emerging
technologies as opposed to traditional Engineering. We recommend that no additional seats are
approved in traditional Engineering areas, but Institutions need to be encouraged to convert current
capacity in traditional disciplines to emerging new technologies.
5. The poor employability of engineering graduates is reflecting poorly on the Faculty-shortage and
quality, and pedagogy. It may be very important to take immediate steps to improve the quality of our
teachers.
a. Competencies of the Faculty need to be developed, especially in the areas of new age technologies
and research through rigorous Faculty development programs. Training of existing teachers at
Teachers Training Institutes, using quality improvement programs (QIP) and using IIT/ NIT Faculty
and Infrastructure are some of the immediate interventions we recommend.
b. To bring about the desired change in the pedagogy in the immediate term, we recommend focused
Industry visits for Faculty for hands-on exposure to the latest technologies. Industry associations
could be leveraged in facilitating this.
c To improve pedagogy, we recommend Engineering Faculty to mandatorily have Certification/
Diploma/ Degree in education.
238} All India Council for Technical Education

11.
Also, we may have to seek more technology interventions such as MOOCs to circumvent some of the
constraints with Faculty shortage and the quality of pedagogy. Students should be given more flexibility
to use MOOCs in their core and optional curricula. Universities and Autonomous Institutions should be
mandated to use MOOCs in the short term.
The low enrolment, lower placements, and low employability are causes for concern. Employment
generation is very critical to a Nation’s economic development. While we are making certain
recommendations on the role that academic Institutes can play in improving the quality of education and
indirectly contribute to the employment generation, all other stakeholders including Government and
Industry should also start putting in place corrective measures to improve the employment generation.
As research becomes democratized, funds would need to be spent most optimally. Institutions need to
build project management capabilities around research to ensure quick turnarounds, reduce cost and
schedule overruns, and better collaborations across Industry and Academia.
Academic Institutions have to continuously monitor the future skill requirements and make suitable
changes to content and pedagogy so that the graduating students have the right capabilities for the
job-in-demand. Hence, an Institutional mechanism for periodic Industry feedback on the technology
upgradation and its impact on job roles needs to be put in place.
There is evidence to point out that the current Industry-Academia interaction requires improvement. We
recommend the following interventions:
a. Analytical tools should be used to understand the impact of various teaching methods and identify
the best methods of executing Coursework and apprenticeship - tightly integrate apprenticeship
with pedagogy.
b. Apprenticeship should be made mandatory on Industry (in some ways it exists but needs rigorous
implementation) and also progressively mandatory on educational Institutions (starting with 25%
moving to 100% in five years).
c Two industry representatives to be part of the Advisory Board of each Institution.
d. Deepening of Industry-Academia partnerships in applied research needs to be encouraged.
e. Establish 20 National Knowledge Functional Hubs (NKFH) as a pilot in AICTE approved Institutions
to create an ecosystem of sustained Industry-Academia engagement.
f. We recommend that AICTE takes the local Industry ecosystem requirements (For instance,
Aerospace and IT Engineering in Bangalore vicinity, Automotive in Chennai and Pune) into
consideration while creating new capacities or increasing the existing capacities to deepen
domain knowledge and to meet the Industry requirements.
g. Simultaneously, we recommend that AICTE balances this step with the National and Global needs
by introducing Courses in new and disrupting technologies which are fungible across the Country.
We have evidence to show that innovation, incubation and Start-up eco system is lacking in educational
Institutions. As has been rightly recognized by Gol, Start-ups are a key driver for employment generation
and wealth creation. Every education Institution should be mandated for the following:
a. Entrepreneurship should be a minor elective for Under Graduates.
b. Tinkering Laboratories similar to ATAL Innovation Laboratories to be setup in every educational
Institution.
c To promote Start-ups, educational Institutions need to setup incubation centres, mentoring clubs,
and accelerator programs.

12. Proxy indicators such as venture capital investments and Engineering R&D investments by large
Companies for forecasting future technology shows a clear trend towards software and internet
Industries, healthcare services, and medical devices and semiconductor Industry. They also clearly
indicate that Artificial Intelligence (Al), Internet of Things (loT), Embedded SW, Internet SW,
Mobility, Analytics, and Cloud are growing at a rapid pace as compared to traditional technologies.
The results of the NASSCOM - BCG study and FICCI-NASSCOM-EY study also concur with this analysis.
Approval Process Handbook £ 2021-22
a. Across all Engineering disciplines, we recommend, that Courses in these emerging technologies are
made part of the curricula and made mandatory for Computer Science, Electrical, and Electronics
Engineering.
b. Specifically, we recommend introducing Under Graduate and Post Graduate Engineering programs
exclusively focused in Artificial Intelligence (Al), Internet of Things (loT), Block chain, Robotics,
Quantum Computing, Data Sciences, Cyber Security, 3D Printing and Design, Augmented Reality/
Virtual Reality (AR/VR).
c Also, we recommend that, we put greater focus on multi-disciplinary Engineering Courses,
especially in Computational Biology, Biotechnology, Biomedical, Mechatronics, Space, Aerospace,
Agriculture, and Environmental Engineering, by reducing the seats in conventional disciplines and
converting some of the existing seats into these areas.
13. Research on future trends in education indicates student-centric learning needs to be given precedence.
a. We recommend students should be encouraged on design thinking and practical approaches to
learning.
b. Students should also be made aware of real life socio-economic problems for them to solve using
technology learnings.
c Technology should be used for individual learning paths for each student.
d. MOE/ AICTE should make investments in innovation in education and incubate education Start-
ups.
e. Open book examinations should be introduced wherever applicable to move students to higher
order cognitive skills.
14. Finally, developing a Perspective Plan for Engineering education should be an ongoing exercise. In
the backdrop of rapidly changing technology environment, Engineering education needs continuous
monitoring. We recommend that one of the Industry bodies or a smaller group of Industry bodies with
the help of Consultants who have a focus on education be tasked with this periodic planning exercise
once every two years.
